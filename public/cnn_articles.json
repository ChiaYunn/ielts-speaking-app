    "content": "Thousands of Palestinians overran anewly established aid sitein southern Gaza on Tuesday that is part of a controversial new Israeli- and US-approved aid distribution mechanism that began on Tuesday after months of blockade.\nVideos from the distribution site in Tel al-Sultan, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), showed large crowds storming the facilities, tearing down some of the fencing and appearing to climb over barriers designed to control the flow of the crowd.\n“I arrived at a place surrounded by Americans and the army. I tried to get closer, but because of the crowd, I couldn’t get anything,” said Wafiq Qdeih.\n“The Israeli army was shooting in the air, and the Americans and their workers retreated, making it impossible to distribute aid to the people. They want order, but there will be no order because these are desperate people who want to eat and drink.”\nSeveral residents trying to access the aid told CNN they were grateful for the food they received, but described walking long distances to reach the distribution center, hours-long lines and general confusion.\n“The place is very far, and we struggled until we arrived. I am tired and exhausted. How can they provide food for all these people? There are too many people here; security will not be able to control them all,” Abu Ramzi said.\nA diplomatic official called the chaos at the site “a surprise to no one.”\nAn 11-week Israeliblockadeon humanitarian aid has pushed the enclave’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians towards famine and into a deepeninghumanitarian crisis, with the first resumption of humanitarian aid trickling into the besieged enclave last week.\nRelated articleIn Gaza, limited food aid meets desperate crowds and looting\nThe GHF acknowledged the pandemonium, saying “the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate. This was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties.” A security source said American security contractors on the ground did not fire any shots and that operations would resume at the site on Wednesday.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said their troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound and that the situation was brought under control. They denied carrying out aerial fire toward the site.\n“It’s a big failure that we warned against,” said Amjad al-Shawa, director of Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network.\n“If Israel believes that through this blockade and emboldening starvation, which violates humanitarian principles, that this distribution method would work, they are mistaken.”\nGHF said it has distributed about 8,000 food boxes totaling 462,000 meals in Gaza so far. They say the flow of meals will increase each day, with a goal of delivering food to 1.2 million – 60% of Gaza’s population – by the end of the week.\nThe GHF claimed it began operating on Monday, but photos from the organization showed only a handful of people carrying boxes of aid, with pallets of boxes sitting at an otherwise empty lot.\nGHF is readying three additional sites for the distribution of aid, two of which are in southern Gaza and one in central Gaza. All of the sites in the south are in an area that fell under a massive evacuation order one day earlier.\nRelated articleHead of controversial US-backed Gaza aid group resigns, citing concerns over independence and impartiality\nThere are no distribution sites in northern Gaza – a point of criticism from many aid experts. The UN has previously warned that the fact the initial sites were only insouthern and central Gazacould be seen as encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.\n“This mechanism appears practically unfeasible, incompatible with humanitarian principles and will create serious insecurity risks, all while failing to meet Israel’s obligations under international law,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs wrote earlier this month in a document obtained by CNN.\nIn a briefing with reporters on Tuesday an Israeli military official said that both the new mechanism and the old mechanism under the United Nations are working now. The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said 95 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday.\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) had earlier said that it is ready, with other humanitarian organizations, “to distribute meaningful quantities of aid the moment we are allowed to” but that the amount of families permitted into Gaza so far have been “minimal.”\nJens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN aid coordination office, has criticized the GHF aid plan as “a distraction from what is actually needed, which is a reopening of all the crossings into Gaza, a secure environment within Gaza and faster facilitation of permissions and final approvals of all the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border.”\nIsrael and the US had declined to name the humanitarian organizations involved in the controversial new mechanism, but images from the GHF showed boxes labeled “Rahma Worldwide,” a Michigan-based non-profit organization that says it provides “aid and assistance to the most vulnerable communities in the world.”\nThis story has been updated.\nDana Karni contributed to this report."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/27/europe/russia-aerial-terror-ukraine-war-intl",
    "content": "Third-grader Stanislav Martynyuk looks extremely proud in his school photograph. Hands folded on his desk; his eyes framed with spectacles that make him look like a serious – and adorable – 8-year-old scholar.\nIt was this image of Stanislav – alongside similar snaps of his sister Tamara, 12, and brother Roman, 17 – that was put on display at a makeshift memorial at their school in Korostyshiv and shared on social media after the three siblings died when a Russian strike hit their home over the weekend.\nThe trio was among at least 14 civilians killed over the weekend in the latest wave of Moscow’sescalating aerial assaultsagainst Ukrainian cities.\nAnalysts say the brutal campaign is part of a deliberate strategy by Russia that is designed to create an impression that it has the upper hand in the conflict, undermine Ukraine’s morale and put more pressure on Kyiv’s Western allies.\nRussia first beganintensifying airborne attacksagainst Ukraine last fall, after it successfully scaled up domestic production of its own version of the Iranian-made Shahed drones, its most frequently used drone.\nBut the frequency and scale of these strikes increased again in January, after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Five of Russia’s biggest drone attacks were all launched since then. Four of the five came over the past 10 days, according to a tally compiled by CNN.\nTrump has made ending the war in Ukraine one of his priorities – having said during the election campaign that he would bring the conflict to an end within 24 hours of taking office.\nBut despite the promises, Trump seems to have grown increasingly impatient with Moscow and Kyiv. He has been flip-flopping between threatening to punish Russia with more sanctions if it doesn’t sign up to a ceasefire proposal and suggesting he could walk away from the issue altogether.\nOver the weekend, after Russia launched its biggest aerial assault against Ukraine since the start of the war, Trump said on social media that Putin“has gone absolutely CRAZY!”before telling reporters that he was “not happy with what Putin is doing.”\nBut Trump also slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for suggesting that “America’s silence” encourages Putin to continue his onslaught. He said Zelensky does his country disservice because “everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that should Ukraine “misbehave” in fighting against Russia with drones, it will “get hurt.”\nNo matter if peace negotiations are underway, or “if President Trump says something or not, Russia will ensure its security,” Peskov said.\nThe only way to win\nAnalysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said that Russia’s brutal aerial campaign is part of the strategy to create the illusion that it is winning the war, in an “effort to degrade Ukrainian morale and convince the West that a Russian victory in Ukraine is inevitable and that supporting Ukraine is futile.”\nPutin knows that the only way Russia could win the war in Ukraine any time soon is if Ukraine’s Western allies, the United States chief among them, stop supporting Kyiv in its war efforts.\nUkraine’s European allies have seen an increase in instances ofsabotage, cyber incidents and arson attackslinked to Russia, an attempt by Moscow to put more pressure on Kyiv-friendly governments by trying to show their voters that supporting Kyiv comes with a cost.\nAt the same time, Putin is successfully stalling the ceasefire talks proposed by Trump – while trying to appear cooperative and shift the blame on Kyiv.\nInstead of refusing Trump’s ceasefire proposal straight away, the Russian president has been introducing new demands and blaming Kyiv for not accepting them.\nWhen given an ultimatum, Putin ignored it and called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia – something Trump immediately endorsed, blindsiding Ukraine’s other Western allies.\nRelated articleRussia is intensifying its air war in Ukraine. A secretive factory is ramping up drone production to fuel the offensive\nTrump has repeatedly indicated he does not want US military assistance to Kyiv to continue as it was. Earlier this year, the US briefly suspended shipments of aid to Ukraine over Trump’s disagreement with Zelensky. While the aid has been reinstated, the incident gave a clear indication to Putin that Trump is willing to abandon Ukraine.\nTrump has also made it clear he believed Ukraine is on the backfoot. He even told Zelensky he had “no cards” during the contentiousOval Office meetingin February, trying to pressure the Ukrainian leader into negotiations.\nBut while Russia does have air superiority over Ukraine, which allows Moscow to terrorize the Ukrainian population on daily basis, it is far from “winning” the war.\nLeading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti previously told CNN that the situation on the ground in Ukraine is better described as both sides losing. “The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,” he said.\nWhen Russia launched its full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin expected to take over the country within a few days.\nThat has not happened because Ukraine mounted a surprisingly strong defense. And as Western support for Kyiv increased, Ukraine was able to push back and reclaim large swaths of territory that were seized by Russia during the initial invasion.\nThe frontline in Ukraine has not moved in a significant way since Ukrainian forces liberated the southern city of Kherson in November 2023. Russia has advanced in some areas along the frontline, but it has not been able to break through or take over a major city.\nYet the consequences of the Russian strikes have been horrifying. At least 209 civilians were killed across Ukraine last month, the deadliest month since September 2024, according to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\nIt was a particularly deadly month for Ukrainian children – the worst since June 2022. On top of 19 who were killed, 78 were injured.\nMay has been equally terrifying for Ukrainian civilians. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram that the weekend’s attacks showed once again that Russia’s goal is “fear and death.”\nKlymenko said the parents of the three slain Martynyuk children were wounded in the strike, their mother seriously.\nRoman, the oldest child, was just days away from graduating, the school where all three attended said in a statement.\nTamara’s teacher, Oleh Hodovaniuk, told CNN Monday was a very difficult day for the school.\nSigns of the war were all around them. The school windows have been blown out by the pressure wave from the explosions. A memorial point at the school’s entrance was flooded with flowers and plush toys.\nHodovaniuk said the news shocked the community to its core and some children were so distraught they were unable to come to school and take part in the memorial.\n“No one coordinated this, but most of the school came wearing black,” he said. “Tamara was very well behaved and modest, like all the children in her family.”"

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/27/americas/king-charles-canada-parliament-speech-intl-latam",
    "content": "King Charles IIIused a significant speech in Canada’s parliament on Tuesday to underscore the country’s sovereignty following pressure from US President Donald Trump.\n“Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect,” the king said from the throne in the Senate chamber as he delivered a speech, which laid out the Canadian government’s legislative agenda for the year ahead.\nCharles, 76, is on a two-day trip to Canada, the first time he has visited the country since assuming the throne in 2022. He is the head of state in Canada and 13 other Commonwealth realms, as well as in the United Kingdom.\nIt was the first time in nearly 50 years that a sovereign had delivered the address and was seen by many as a powerful show of support for Canada.\nKing Charles’ remarks comes as Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Canada and make it the 51st state — a move which Canadian Prime MinisterMark Carneyhas repeatedly rebuffed.\nRelated articleCanadians are boycotting the US. Are American travelers still welcome in Canada?\nDuring the roughly 26-minute address, which was written by the Canadian government, Charles spoke of the several challenges the nation faced. “The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada’s relationships with partners are also changing.”\nKing Charles discussed the changing relationship between Canada and the United States.\n“The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations,” he said.\nCharles also referenced protecting Canada’s sovereignty, saying that the government would look at “rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces.”\nHe said the government “will boost Canada’s defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada’s European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.”\nThe monarch added: “The government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad.”\nKing Charles on Tuesday also emphasized that “the Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada,” adding that “it also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present.”\n‘Delicate balancing act’\nCharles and his wife,Camilla, made their way to parliament by carriage through the streets of the capital.\nAs the king formally opened a new session of parliament, he outlined some of Carney’s other priorities, which also focused on domestic issues such as more affordable housing, a tax cut for the middle class and the removal of barriers to interprovincial trade — themes the prime minister promised voters during the recent election campaign.\nThe king alternated between speaking in English and French – the two official languages of Canada – and received a standing ovation after wrapping up the speech.\nJeffrey Dvorkin, journalist and senior fellow at Massey College in Toronto, described the speech as a “delicate balancing act” after the recent unwanted attention from Trump, but one that touched upon key issues and tensions in Canada.\nRelated articleKing Charles makes ‘impactful’ trip to Canada as Trump pushes 51st state claim\n“What it also did — really quite deliberately — was send a message to the administration of Donald Trump that the country is going to go in a somewhat different direction than it has in the past,” he told CNN.\n“Geography has been the greatest uniting force. But now under Prime Minister Carney, Canadians are looking overseas for a different set of connections without necessarily separating from the best connections that Canada has with the United States,” he continued.\n“But it certainly was a message to the Trump administration that those days of Canada accepting everything that the United States tries to do, those days are over.”\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla were warmly welcomed on the tarmac as the couple touched down in Ottawa on Monday afternoon by Carney and Canadian Governor General Mary Simon, the monarch’s representative in the country.\nOn Monday, Carney – who was elected in March largely on an anti-Trump platform - praised the “historic ties” between Canada and the United Kingdom which “crises only fortify.”"

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/27/middleeast/germany-merz-criticizes-israel-latam-intl",
    "content": "For decades, Germany has stood squarely inIsrael’scorner, its dark history of Jewish persecution shaping its modern-day policy of virtually unquestioned backing.\nIn the aftermath of the Hamas October 7, 2023, attacks, the question of German political andmilitarysupport for Israel was raised – and reaffirmed by then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nBut comments by new Chancellor Friedrich Merz in recent days have put Germany’s support for Israel under the spotlight.\n“We are dismayed by the fate of the civilian population and the terrible suffering of the civilian population” in Gaza, the chancellor said on Tuesday while on a visit to Turku, Finland.\nThe question of what provoked Merz’s sharp change in tone toward Israel remains unclear. Peter Lintl, an analyst from the German Institute of International and Security Affairs who focuses on German-Israeli relations, believes Merz wanted to get into office, start conversations with Israeli leaders and get an understanding of the direction of travel before outlining his stance.\nRelated videoTensions flare in Jerusalem as ultra-nationalist Israeli Jews march\n“The conclusion, that most of the countries in the world came to, it’s a horrible war where the aim is not clear anymore,” Lintl told CNN. “It is clearly a change in tone and change in positioning of the German government.”\nMerz followed his Tuesday comments by questioning the current actions of the Israel Defense Forces inside Gaza.\nReferring to Israel’s expanded operations and the humanitarian crisis in the territory, the German chancellor said that he “no longer sees any logic as to how they serve the goal of fighting terror and freeing the hostages. In this respect, I take a very, very critical view of what has happened in the last few days.”\nTuesday’s language came hot on the heels of a thinly veiled threat from Merz in Berlin on Monday. “The Israeli government must not do anything that its best friends are no longer prepared to accept,” he said.\nMerz has also done the previously unthinkable and questioned whether Israel may be violating international law.\nNational interest\nThe change of tone is particularly striking because of Germany’s long-standing stance on Israel, that is connected to a theory known as “staatsraison”or national interest.\nThe connection of staatsraison and Israel were made by then-Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2008.\nShe told the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, that the “historical responsibility of Germany is part of my country’s national interest (staatsraison). This means that, for me as German chancellor, Israel’s security is never negotiable.”\nSimilar words were also used by Scholz in the wake of the October 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped some 250 others.\nSince Merkel’s speech, and particularly after she stepped down as chancellor in 2021, “the term got a life of its own,” the analyst Lintl says.\n“It appeared that if you want to be a respected politician, you have to use the term because it came to signal … that Israel’s security is German staatsraison.Itis the minimum threshold we use to distance ourselves from the past,” Lintl says.\nThat “past” refers largely to the Holocaust in which the Nazis killed more than 6 million Jews.\nRelated articleUS envoy says Gaza ceasefire deal is on the table, as Israel prepares to launch an ‘unprecedented attack’\nIn Finland on Tuesday, Merz was quick to reiterate he is not abandoning staatsraisonentirely.“Israel’s security and existence are, as we have been saying for many years and decades, part of our German staatsraison,” but he has clearly set out to clarify it.\nLintl added: “We didn’t know how this government will conduct itself, or how this government policy toward Israel will look – right now we have more of an idea.”\nIt remains unclear if Merz and Germany’s relationship with Israel will shift significantly.\nMerz has maintained he will continue to talk with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Merz has also said he would find “ways and means” for Israel’s prime minister to visit Germany given the ICC (International Criminal Court) arrest warrant out for him.\nFor now, the statements from Israel seem muted, and respectful.\nThe Israeli Ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor told German TV Tuesday morning, “when somebody criticizes Israel, and when Friedrich Merz makes this criticism, we listen very carefully because he is a friend.”\nInke Kappler contributed reporting."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/27/uk/liverpool-parade-collision-incident-explainer-gbr-intl",
    "content": "Monday began as a day of celebration for many in Liverpool, the free-spirited, soccer-loving city in northwest England. It ended in panic and horror, aftera car rammed crowdsand injured dozens of people, including children.\nPolice are now picking through the details of the disturbing incident in the center of the city, which saw the vehicle tear through fans celebrating the Liverpool soccer team’s Premier League title win.\nAn arrest was quickly made, but plenty of questions remain – including why a 53-year-old man drove into a throng of people.\nHere’s what we know.\nWhat happened in Liverpool?\nLiverpool was awash with red on Monday, with hundreds of thousands of soccer fans cramming its streets to watch an open-top bus parade celebrating the club’s20th league title.\nBut just after 6 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET), concern began to trickle through the crowds. Merseyside Police said they had made an arrest, “following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians on Water Street.”\nFootage posted online appeared to show the car surrounded by fans, with a confrontation between the driver and members of the crowd. The vehicle then sped up and veered from right to left across the street, another video showed, knocking people to the ground and causing a frenzied scrum before coming to a stop.\n“It was extremely fast,” eyewitness Harry Rashid told Britain’s PA Media news agency. “Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.”\nHow many were hurt?\nA total of 65 victims were injured in the crash, with 50 people receiving treatment at hospital, authorities said in a news conference. Of those injured, 11 remained in hospital. Police said that they are all in “stable condition” and “appear to be recovering well.”\nFour people, including a child, were trapped under the car and needed rescuing by firefighters, Nick Searle, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service chief fire officer, added.\nWho is the suspect?\nA 53-year-old White British man, believed to be the driver, was quickly arrested at the scene, according to Merseyside Police.\nThe man is from Liverpool, police added.\nOfficers described the collision as an “isolated incident,” and said they were not looking for any other suspects and were not treating the incident as terrorism.\nIn the news conference, police said the suspect remains in custody on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs.\nIt is believed he was able to enter Water Street, which was closed off to vehicles, by following an ambulance that was allowed onto the street.\nWhy did police release the suspect’s ethnicity?\nMonday’s incident, and the uncertainty that followed, brought back painful memories from another tragedy in the area; the horrific stabbing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event last year in Southport, 20 miles north of Liverpool.\nAxel Rudakubana, 18,admitted killingthe girls and stabbing 10 others in the attack, which stunned the country. He was sentenced to at least 52 years in prison in January.\nIn the days of anger and confusion that followed the incident,misinformation about the suspectcirculated online. Far-right groups promoted a false rumor that the attacker was a migrant, leading to days of race riots that saw crowds of agitators target and attack hotels housing asylum seekers.\nThose events may have informed the decision by Merseyside Police, which also responded to the Southport attacks, to quickly release the information that the suspect was White – an unusual step in the early hours of an investigation.\n“I’ve never known a case like this before where they’ve given the ethnicity and the race of the individual who was involved in it (so quickly),” Dal Babu, the former Chief Superintendent of London’s Metropolitan Police, told the BBC Tuesday. “I think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak.”\nBut other factors may also be at play – including the fact that terrorism was quickly ruled out as a motive, removing some sensibilities around the information that is made public.\nHow did the world of soccer react?\nThe trophy parade was organized on a nationwide bank holiday, the day after Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy following the competition’s final round of matches on Sunday.\nIn a short statement, the club said they were in contact with police and added: “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident.”\nA swell of support also came from the rest of the football community. Everton, Liverpool’s bitter on-field rivals, senta message of support. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher called it a “devastating end to the day.”\nAnd Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool’s former manager who was on the open-top bus parade, said: “My family and I are shocked and devastated. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who are injured and affected.\n“You’ll never walk alone,” Klopp added, referencing the show tune famously covered by Liverpool group Gerry and Pacemakers in 1963, which is now synonymous with the team and sung by fans before every game. Its lyrics were immediately shared across social media on Monday after news of the incident emerged.\nWhat happens now?\nThe scene of the collision was quickly secured. On Tuesday morning, fireworks and other debris littered the cordoned-off street, relics of a party that turned disastrous.\n“Liverpool stands together and the whole country stands with Liverpool,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Tuesday.\nThe investigation into the cause and circumstances surrounding the incident are ongoing.\n“I’ve no idea how that car got there,” the area’s MP Kim Johnson told reporters at the scene. “Liverpool City Council and our emergency services are well versed in terms of supporting these types of large events and safeguarding the public with these types of events.”\nCNN’s Eve Brennan, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Catherine Nicholls and Helen Regan contributed reporting."

    "content": "The head of a new aid distribution program for Gaza, backed by the US and Israel, resigned on Sunday after weeks of controversy, citing concerns over impartiality and urging Israel to allow more aid into the blockaded enclave.\nOn Monday, the group said it had began operations in Gaza, however it is not yet clear whether the aid has reached civilians.\nTheGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF) is meant to run a new, tightly controlled, mechanism for aid deliveries into Gaza, but it has been criticized by the United Nations and others, who warn it risks further displacing Palestinians and endangering civilians.\nUS military veteranJake Woodquit as GHF’s executive director after just a matter of weeks at the organization, publicly launched by the US in early May.\n“I am proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza,” said Wood in a statement.\n“However, it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon,” he added.\nRelated articleA US-backed group says it will deliver aid to Gaza, but humanitarian organizations are skeptical. Here’s what we know\nThe GHF said in a statement it was “disappointed” by Wood’s resignation, criticizing opponents who they said “have been more focused on tearing this apart than on getting aid in.” On Monday it announced the interim executive director would be John Acree, a “a senior humanitarian practitioner with more than two decades of global field experience in disaster response, stabilization programming, and civil-military coordination.”\nThe organization said it delivered truckloads of food to its secure distribution sites, on Monday “where distribution to the Gazan people began.”\nThe statement added that more aid trucks would be delivered the following day and that the flow of aid would increase daily.\nThe foundation released pictures showing men carrying cardboard boxes by hand on their shoulders. The foundation said the pictures were taken in Rafah. CNN has been unable to geolocate the images.\nThe GHF’s plan for delivering aid has been approved by Israel and the US, which both countries say is designed to prevent Hamas from “stealing” aid.\nThe organization said in its Monday statement that Hamas was making “death threats targeting aid groups supporting humanitarian operations at GHF’s Safe Distribution Sites.”\n“It is clear that Hamas is threatened by this new operating model, and will do everything in its power to see it fail,” GHF said.\nThe group is supposed to start operating four distribution sites, all located insouthern and central Gaza– but it has come under heavy criticism from top humanitarian officials, with the UN and other organizations refusing to work with the new group.\nThe UN warned that the fact the initial sites were only insouthern and central Gazacould be seen as encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.\nThe US and the GHF have both been at pains to say that it is not an Israeli initiative – despite Israel’s support for it, and its role in designating and securing the distribution sites.\nSpeaking to CNN earlier in May, Wood had urged the UN and other groups to reconsider their opposition, admitting that the plan was “not perfect,” but would allow critical aid and food supplies to Gazans who desperately need it.\nHe added in May that he “unequivocally… will not be a part of anything that forcibly dislocates or displaces the Palestinian population.”\nIn his resignation statement on Sunday, he said he had sought to establish the foundation “as a truly independent humanitarian entity” during his time as its executive director.\nWood said he was “horrified and heartbroken at the hunger crisis in Gaza” and was “compelled to do whatever I could to help alleviate the suffering.”\n“I urge Israel to significantly expand the provision of aid into Gaza through all mechanisms, and I urge all stakeholders to continue to explore innovative new methods for the delivery of aid, without delay, diversion, or discrimination,” Wood said.\nThe GHF is only expected to be able to feed about 60% of Gaza’s population in its first weeks.\nA private American security contractor will be responsible for guarding its aid trucks from the Gaza border to the distribution sites and will not be involved in distributing the aid to civilians, Wood had previously said.\nStarvation in Gaza\nGaza faces widespread starvation amid a severe shortage of essential humanitarian aid. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has recorded 58 deaths from malnutrition and 242 deaths from shortages of food and medicine since Israel’s blockade on aid began in March, it said.\nMore than 300 miscarriages had been attributed to a lack of nutrients, the ministry told CNN on Sunday.\nLast week, Israel said it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza due to an “operational need” as the military pushes ahead with its offensive, dubbed “Gideon’s Chariots.” The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has said a hunger crisis in Gaza could jeopardize the operation, which  Israel says aims to defeat Hamas.\nAhmad Al-Banna, who owns a bakery in Deir al-Balah in Gaza, told CNN Sunday that he had reopened on Wednesday, only to close three days later, because flour stocks had run out.\n“Gaza is exhausted,” he said. “There are starving people in the streets.”\nAnother resident, Um Jamal Musleh, said she and her two children relied on the local charity-run kitchen. “Today, we were shocked to see a sign saying it’s the last day for the kitchen. That means we’ll go hungry,” she said.\nAsmaa Al-Kafarneh, who was waiting at the kitchen on Sunday, said she had not eaten bread in two months. “If we don’t die from Israeli airstrikes, we’ll die of hunger,” she said.\nIsrael said it allowed 107 aid trucks into the territory on Sunday and 170 on Monday – but the UN has said that’s not nearly enough.\nThe enclave needs at least 500 to 600 trucks daily to avert a deepening humanitarian catastrophe, as civilians face a severe shortage of supplies like food and medicine, said UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza. The UN has also complained that Israel has insisted on humanitarian aid traveling along insecure routes, preventing many aid trucks from safely arriving at their destinations."

    "content": "“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, butsomething has happenedto him,” observed US PresidentDonald Trump, reacting to the intensive Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine over the weekend.\nIn fact, the Kremlin leader seems pretty much unchanged, despite the urgings of the White House, merely continuing his policy of grinding war in Ukraine, in which aerial assaults have become an all-too-regular feature.\nThe real question is whether Trump has changed, or at least if his attitude toward Putin has started to shift amid what looks like an increasingly futile US effort to forge peace inUkraine, something Trump bragged he could do – let’s not forget – in short order.\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, certainly thinks a mental corner has been turned, telling reporters in Vietnam that Trump’s latest rebuke of his Russian counterpart as “absolutely CRAZY” means the US president “realizes” that Putin has “lied” on the war in Ukraine, adding that he hopes Trump’s words will “translate into action.”\nBut the record suggests otherwise.\nThis is the sixth time this term that Trump, who consistently says he has a strong relationship with Putin, has publicly expressed impatience or downright annoyance with the Kremlin boss.\nRelated articleTrump says Putin ‘has gone absolutely crazy’ after major Russian attacks on Ukraine\nBack in March, Trump revealed he was “pissed off” with Putin for refusing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire.\nIn April, Trump demanded “Vladimir STOP,” after a Russian missile strike on Kyiv left a dozen people dead.\n“Maybe he doesn’t really want to stop the war and is just tapping me along,” Trump mused later.\nThe Trump scoldings have been routinely accompanied by expressions of personal disappointment and threats of possible retaliation, like secondary tariffs on “all oil coming out ofRussia,” or unidentified “further sanctions.”\nAsked again, after the latest rebuke of Putin, whether he would now consider putting more sanctions on Russia, Trump replied: “Absolutely.”\nSo far, there has been no real sign that Trump is prepared to use the substantial economic leverage at his disposal to force the Kremlin to rethink its hardline stance.\nNot so in the US Senate, where a cross-party bill has been introduced to make it more difficult for Russia to fund its war.\nThe bill, now backed by 81 senators, not only proposes more direct sanctions on Russia, but also secondary sanctions, such as a massive 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy.\nBut the measures, which would seriously impact an already fragile and oil-dependent Russian economy, are super-controversial as they would also punish China, India and the European Union, which are all still major Russian energy consumers.\nIt is, of course, possible that Trump could now throw his weight behind the bill, or perhaps a watered-down version of it. But that would be a huge change in direction, given his consistent reluctance to confront and punish the Kremlin so far.\nMore likely, the latest upsurge in violence in Ukraine may further convince an already frustrated US president that he is simply unable to bring the warring parties together any time soon.\nAnd, amid all his anger and bluster about Putin, Trump may simply choose to walk away."

    "content": "Britain’s King Charles IIIarrivedin Canadaon Monday for his first visit as its head of state, where he’ll carry out a highly-symbolic whistle-stop trip seen by many as a show of support following increasinglyfrayed relationsbetween Ottawa and Washington.\nDuring his two-day visit, Charles, 76, will deliver a speech in Canada’s parliament and celebrate the country’s cultural heritage and diversity, according to Buckingham Palace. He will be accompanied by his wife, Queen Camilla.\nSoon after their arrival on Monday, Charles and Camilla will meet with community organizations at an Ottawa park, according to the Canadian Prime Minister’s Office. Later on Monday, the pair will plant a tree on the grounds ofRideau Hall, the monarch’s usual residence while visiting Canada.\nCharles — who is still undergoing treatment for cancer — will attend the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday, where he will deliver the ceremonial Speech from the Throne to the Senate chamber. The address marks only the second time in Canadian history that the reigning sovereign has opened parliament, and the third time that the British monarch has delivered the Speech from the Throne.\nThe parliamentary address is typically delivered by the governor general, the British monarch’s representative in Canada.\nIn a statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney offered a preview of Charles’ address, writing that “the Speech from the Throne will outline the government’s ambitious plan to act with urgency and determination, and to deliver the change Canadians want and deserve.”\nAmong the facets of that plan, according to Carney, is “a new economic and security relationship with the United States.” Charles’ visit comes as US President Donald Trump persistently references his desire to make Canada the 51st state and touts false claims that the Canadian public likes the idea of being annexed by the United States. In fact, the proposal is overwhelmingly unpopular among Canadians as a whole.\nCarney, who rose to power on a tide of anti-Trump sentiment in March, has repeatedly denounced the US president’s remarks. In his election victory speech, Carney warned that Canada would never yield to Trump’s relentless provocations.\nCarneydoubled downon that message last month during an exchange with Trump in the Oval Office.\n“As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” Carney told Trump, adding: “(Canada) is not for sale. It won’t be for sale, ever.”\nAhead of Charles’ trip to Ottawa, Canada’s envoy to the United Kingdom, Ralph Goodale, told reporters the king will “reinforce” that same directive, according to Reuters.\n“The prime minister (Carney) has made it clear that Canada is not for sale now, is not for sale ever,” Goodale told journalists last week.\n“The king, as head of state, will reinforce the power and strength of that message,” Goodale said.\nAn ‘impactful’ visit\nCharles will also need to walk a careful diplomatic tightrope as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer seeks a stronger relationship with Trump over Ukraine and as he continues to pursue economic and trade guarantees.\nRelated articleA family divide shows how the ‘strongest bond’ between US and Canada is being broken\nCarney said last week that his compatriots “weren’t impressed” after Charles extended a second state invitation to the US president. Trump would be the first elected political leader in modern times to be hosted twice by a British monarch.\n“It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,” Carney said.\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla are “mindful” of the gravity of their upcoming visit, Buckingham Palace said, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.\n“The King and Queen are very much looking forward to the programme, mindful that it is a short visit but hopefully an impactful one,” PA reported, citing a palace spokesperson.\nCNN’s Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Paula Newton contributed reporting."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/23/world/harvard-international-students-trump-intl",
    "content": "International Harvard students say they are experiencing “pure panic” amid the Trump administration’s move tobar foreign enrollment, as students from around the world told CNN they are coming to grips with the possibility of revoked visas, suspended research and being blocked from reentry to the United States if they leave this summer.\nA federal judgetemporarily haltedthe Trump administration’s ban on Friday after the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college filed suit in federal court. Harvard argued revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government’s ideologically rooted policy demands.\nBut thousands of international students remain in limbo and are “very clearly, extremely afraid” because they don’t know their current legal status, Harvard student body co-president Abdullah Shahid Sial, who is from Lahore, Pakistan, told CNN on Friday.\n“They’re literally like, teenagers, thousands of miles away from their hometowns having to deal with this situation, which lawyers often fear to engage in,” said Sial, who is traveling overseas after exams.\nSial, speaking Saturday from Japan, told CNN he is unsure whether he will be allowed back into the US, or if he will be able to stay.\n“As of right now, I’m not sure if I can attend the next semester or not,” he said.\nHarvard’s international students continued to be a focus of President Donald Trump over the holiday weekend. Hepostedon Truth Social shortly after midnight Sunday morning, saying he wants “names and countries” of Harvard’s international students.\nThe demand confused Sial since the federal government maintains adatabaseof all foreign students.\n“The US government does have a list of every single person who is studying at Harvard (as an international student),” Sial said Monday. “The names are already there.”\nIn its latestlawsuitagainst the government, Harvard said it has complied with Department of Homeland Securityrequestsfor more detailed information but argues the Trump administrationhasa “lack of any clear authority for most of the requests.”\nRelated videoHarvard student body president says international students are “being used as poker chips”\nAbout 27% of Harvard’s student body is international, with 6,793 international undergraduates and grad students hailing from nearly every country in the world.\n“Harvard is Harvard because it has the ability to attract people – the best people – from all over the world, not just the United States,” Sial told CNN on Friday. “The US also benefits heavily from having the best in the world come to the university and study. And then they’ve been dehumanized and disrespected.”\nSial said the university and deans have been helpful in supporting international students at a time of uncertainty and “pure panic,” which is happening days after final exams ended and just one week before graduation.\nAs student body president, he says he is working to encourage the university to assist international students who want to transfer to other colleges and pushing for students’ financial aid packages to transfer, as well. But the window to transfer to other universities for the fall semester is already closed at most colleges, Sial said.\n“Many of us have worked our entire lives to get to a university like Harvard, and now we need to wait around and see if we might have to transfer out and face difficulties with visas,” says rising junior Karl Molden, from Austria.\nMolden, who is also traveling abroad and concerned he won’t be allowed to return to campus, said he feels international students are being used as a “ball in this larger fight between democracy and authoritarianism.”\nJared, an 18-year-old in New Zealand, was just accepted to Harvard and had been planning to start undergraduate studies at the Ivy League school this fall. He told CNN it was a “heart drop” moment when he learned of the Trump administration’s announcement – which came in the midst of applying for his student visa and preparing to move the 9,000 miles to Boston.\nJewish students ‘being used as pawns,’ says one Israeli student\nHarvard and Trump officials have been locked in conflict for months as the administration demands the university make changes to campus programming, policies, hiring and admissions to root out what the White House has called antisemitism and “racist” practices.\nLike many other colleges and universities, Harvard drew intense criticism last year for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests and encampments following the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as well as complaints from Jewish alumni and students about antisemitism on campus.\nHarvard hasacknowledged antisemitismon its campus, particularly during the previous academic year, and said it has begun taking concrete action to address it.\nAn Israeli postdoctoral student studying at Harvard said she feels like Jewish students are “being used as pawns” by the Trump administration, which hasaccused the university of perpetuating an unsafe campus environmentthat is “hostile to Jewish students” and “employs racist diversity, equity and inclusion practices.”\nThe Israeli student, who did not want to be named in fear of being denied reentry to the United States, said she believed the Trump administration was “using” the university to “have this battle with academia that is much bigger than Harvard.”\nRelated articleAttacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute\nShe said the government was clamping down on ideas that “don’t always align with the administration, rather than (having) an actual concern for the safety of Jewish students, Israeli students.”\n“So, I do feel like we’re being used,” she said, adding that she thinks university leadership istaking the issue of antisemitism on campus seriously. “I don’t want to diminish anyone’s experience at the university. I know people have had tough experiences, but I do feel like I have, personally, 100% trust and faith in our leadership.”\nAnother Israeli master’s student studying at Harvard, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns about how speaking publicly might impact their studies, told CNN it is “very important for Israelis and Jewish people to come here and still be very strong in what they believe in … And not only in Harvard, I would say in American academia and on American campuses right now, more than ever.”\nYoung researchers say they will leave US\nOne graduate student from Australia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being denied future US visas, told CNN it “feels extraordinary that we are all being punished” for campus activism, given that researchers and PhD students often don’t have the time or interest to engage.\n“As a graduate student, we are just fully occupied with our research work, which I would say I spend 80 to 100 hours on each week,” said the Australian student, adding that the showdown between the Trump administration and Harvard will likely lead to researchers leaving the country. “If things really hit the fan, (I) would probably be trying to transfer to a school in the UK.”\nOther graduate students said they are also feeling fear and uncertainty, with concerns for their research work, their future careers and their loved ones.\n“There’s the ramifications for their family, you know, spouses, their children, their enrollment, their work status, their rent, housing, everything,” said Fangzhou Jiang, 30, from China. He is a Harvard Kennedy School student going into his second year of a master’s program. “You just don’t know what’s going to happen.”\nFacing deportation from the US, and retribution at home\nFor some international students, like those from countries at war or experiencing political turmoil, the stakes are even higher.\nMaria Kuznetsova, a former spokesperson for OVD-Info, a Russian independent human rights monitoring group, is currently a graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. She’s graduating in a week and had planned to work on a Harvard-sponsored visa that had already been granted, but she fears it may be canceled now.\n“I used to work in Russian human rights and in the opposition, which means I can’t return to Russia,” Kuznetsova told CNN. “And since I’ve been living in the US for two years now, I don’t even have a European visa. So, I don’t really know where I could even go geographically if things go wrong.”\n“From what I see, people are still in a state of panic – everyone’s waiting for the court’s decision,” Kuznetsova said.\n“It’s not just me from Russia here – there are also many Ukrainians, a lot of political students from Venezuela, and people from Afghanistan and Palestine. I even have a classmate from North Korea. These are people who, quite literally, cannot return to their home countries,” she added.\nSteven Pinker, Harvard University Professor of Psychology, says \"The Trump administration is following the handbook of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships\" by going after universities, law firms and media organizations that potentially oppose its policies.\nRelated videoHarvard professor on Trump Administration barring enrollment of foreign students at university\nIvan Bogantsev, also from Russia, was planning to stay in the US after completing his program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. His wife, currently in Russia and also on a Harvard-sponsored visa, is due to arrive for his graduation, but he’s unsure whether she’ll be allowed entry.\n“No one seems able to explain whether we’re at risk of deportation or not,” Bogantsev told CNN. “I believe a brain drain from this country is absolutely guaranteed. I can’t say to what extent, but the environment here is extremely unfriendly.”\nBut he said going back to Russia is not an option he is considering.\n“I was detained at rallies (in Russia), and let’s just say the atmosphere was growing increasingly tense. And secondly, most of my friends are essentially labeled (in Russia) as criminals, traitors or foreign agents.”\n‘Harvard campus will not be the same’\nLeo Gerdén, from Sweden, who is supposed to graduate next week, told CNN that some of his friends still at Harvard “are making new plans of transferring, especially to other institutions abroad.”\n“I was looking forward to celebrating commencement next week, but now, you know, I might leave this place and it will not look the same next semester, because without these international students and its international researchers, the Harvard campus will not be the same,” Gerdén said.\n“We are being used essentially as poker chips in a battle between the White House and Harvard, and it feels honestly very dehumanizing.”\nCNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Helen Regan, Todd Symons and Isa Soares contributed to this report."

    "content": "The Kremlin has slammed a “dangerous” decision by Ukraine’s allies to lift the ban on Kyiv firing long-range missiles into Russia after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said there were no longer any range restrictions on Western-supplied weapons.\nSpeaking after days of Russia bombarding the Ukrainian capital and other regions with massive aerial attacks, the German chancellor said Monday that his country and other allies had lifted range restrictions.\n“There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine. Neither from the British, nor from the French, nor from us. Nor by the Americans,” Merz said at an event held by the German public broadcaster WDR.\n“In other words, Ukraine can now defend itself, even by attacking military positions in Russia, for example. It wasn’t able to do that until some time ago. With very few exceptions, it didn’t do that until a while ago either,” Merz explained.\nOn Tuesday, after his quotes were interpreted as an announcement of new policy, Merz said this “has been the case for months.”\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov slammed Merz’s announcement on Monday, saying the lifting of restrictions was “rather dangerous,” according to Russia’s state-owned news agencyTASS.\n“If such decisions are made, they will absolutely go against our aspirations to reach a political settlement and the efforts being made within the framework of the settlement,” he said, according to TASS.\nRussia has previously openly threatened that any lifting of restrictions on long-range weapons would mean war with NATO.\nPutin has warned the West that Moscow would consider any assault supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack – and that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles.\nRelated articleUkraine wants to fire Western long-range weapons into Russia. But the battlefield gain is not clear-cut\nThe threat of using nuclear weapons was a significant escalation in rhetoric by the Kremlin – although it did not act on the threat once Kyiv started using UK and US made missiles to strike inside Russia’s territory.\nUkraine’s key allies had in the past resisted Ukraine’s requests to use Western-supplied weapons deep inside Russia. That has changed late last year, when former US President Joe Biden gave a green light to Ukraine to use the US-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, inside Russia.\nBut that, too, was a controversial decision that took months of discussion to reach. The US refused to even provide ATACMS to Ukraine for the first two years of the war, only delivering the missiles for the first time in April 2024. Some American officials worried about escalating the war, now in its fourth year, while others worried about the Pentagon’s dwindling weapons stockpiles.\nMerz was appointed chancellor several weeks ago – and his declaration that Berlin would allow Ukraine to use German-made long range weapons to strike inside Russia stands in stark contrast with his predecessor Olaf Scholz, who had repeatedly rejected Ukraine’s calls to lift the restrictions.\nHowever, Merz did not say whether Germany would supply Ukraine with its powerful long-range Taurus missiles – something he had supported when Scholz was still in power,Reuters reported.\nThe comments from Merz came in the wake of record-breaking drone and missile attacks on Ukraine over the weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing international pressure to accept a ceasefire deal, including from US President Donald Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated by the slow progress.\nRelated articleUS ‘silence’ encouraging Putin, says Zelensky, after Russia launches record air assault\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit Berlin on Wednesday, Reuters reported, citing several sources.\nRussia’s attacks over the weekend killed more than two dozen people, including children, as Ukraine urged Western allies to continue pressuring Moscow to end the war.\n“Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Zelensky said on Sunday.\nTrump on Monday voiced increasingfrustration with Putin, saying the Russian leader had “gone absolutely crazy” – while also criticizing Zelensky’s statements as causing “problems.”\nPressure is also building from within Trump’s Republican base, with a number of congressmen – including Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, and Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Don Bacon – urging the president to impose stringent sanctions on Russia.\n“It is a time for honesty. Peace talks are having zero effect on Putin,” Baconwrote on X.“The US and allies must arm Ukraine to the teeth.”\nThis story has been updated.\nCNN’s Stephanie Halasz contributed reporting."

    "content": "Dozens of people, including four children, were injured when a driver plowed a car into aparade in northwest England celebrating Liverpool Football Club’s latest Premier League win on Monday evening.\nA 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, believed to be the driver, was arrested at the scene, according to Merseyside Police. Describing the collision as an “isolated incident,” police said they were not looking for any other suspects and were not treating the incident as terrorism.\nPolice will reveal the findings of an investigation into the collision so that “all the facts are known,” according to Liverpool’s mayor, Steve Rotheram.\n“It’s not for people on social media to be speculating what happened,” the mayor told CNN on Tuesday, describing the “terrible event” late Monday. “The police are the only people who have all of that information to hand – and they are the people we should trust.”\nFootage from Reuters news agency on Tuesday morning shows the scene littered with debris and closed off with police tape. A police van is parked across the street, blocking the road.\nHundreds of thousands of jubilant soccer fans had lined the streets in the heart of Liverpool on Monday, waving flags and flares of red smoke, to watch an open-top bus victory parade to celebrate the iconic club’s 20th top-flight league title.\nAs the parade was winding down, those scenes of joy turned to chaos. Video from social media appears to show a gray minivan plowing into red-clad supporters. The angry crowd can then be seen surrounding and rocking the stopped vehicle.\nA total of 27 people were taken to hospital, the head of service at North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust David Kitchin told a news conference. Four of those were “very ill in hospital,” according to Rotheram.\nFour people – three adults and one child – had to be removed because they were trapped underneath the vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service Nick Searle. A further 20 people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, he added.\n“This gray people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us … It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car,” one fan, Harry Rashid, told the UK’s PA Media news agency.\nRashid, who attended the parade with his wife and two young daughters, said crowds of people ran over and started to smash the car’s windows. “It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people … I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous,” he said.\nVideo posted on social media appears to show a confrontation between the driver and the crowd at one point during the incident. The car is seen stopped and some in the crowd can be seen kicking and punching the car, which then quickly reverses before driving off.\nOnlooker Matthew O’Carroll told Britain’s PA news agency that he saw the car approaching the top of Water Street. He said the vehicle drove past a parked police van at a “decent” speed and that the driver was beeping as he went through the crowd.\nFootage shared by Reuters news agency showed emergency services tending to people, some being carried into ambulances on stretchers. Photos from the scene also showed authorities cordoning off the heavily littered roads. Police set up a tent where the crash occurred.\n“We heard a frantic beeping ahead, a car flew past me and my mate, people were chasing it and trying to stop him, windows smashed at the back,” Peter Jones, who had traveled to Liverpool to attend the parade, told the Associated Press. “He then drove into people, police and medics ran past us, and people were being treated on the side of the road.”\nThe local police force said they were contacted just after 6 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET) “following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians” in the city center.\nMerseyside Police said it had been working with the organizers of the parade and a “robust traffic management” plan was put in place before the incident unfolded.\n“Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision and it is vital that people do not speculate or spread misinformation on social media,” Merseyside Police’s Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said in a statement.\n‘You’ll never walk alone’\nThe parade on Monday – which coincided with a separate May public holiday in the UK – involved players from the Liverpool squad being driven around the city center in an open-top bus and gleeful fans had joined the festivities along the 10-mile (16 kilometers) route.\nFigures from across the sporting world paid tribute to those who were injured by the attack, which survivors say left the city reeling after the celebrations.\nFormer Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who attended the parade, said he was “shocked and devastated.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who are injured and affected,” he posted on Instagram. “You’ll never walk alone,” he added, in reference to the club’s anthem. A titan of world soccer, the German notably led Liverpool to its first league title in 30 years, in 2020.\nLongtime opponents Manchester United and, Everton Football Club, the local rival team to Liverpool FC, offered their condolences online – as did the Premier League.\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the whole country “stands with Liverpool” on Tuesday. “My thoughts and the thoughts of the whole country are with all of those that are affected, those injured, which of course includes children, their families, their friends… Liverpool fans everywhere,” the prime minister added, thanking emergency services “who did a fantastic job and continue to do so.”\nThis story has been updated with the latest developments.\nCNN’s Nic Robertson contributed reporting from Liverpool, northern England."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/26/europe/macron-brigitte-shove-vietnam-intl",
    "content": "French PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas dismissed a viral video showing his wife Brigitte pushing his face away as they disembarked from a plane in Vietnam for the first leg of a Southeast Asia tour.\nSpeaking to reporters in Hanoi on Monday, Macron addressed the clip directly, pushing back against the speculation it sparked.\n“There’s a video showing me joking and teasing my wife and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it,” the president said.\nMacron acknowledged the footage was genuine but criticized how it had been weaponized. “The videos are all real, and yes, sometimes people tamper with them, but people are attributing all kinds of nonsense to them.”\nThe short clip shows the aircraft door opening withMacronappearing in the doorway. Seconds later, both of Brigitte Macron’s hands reach out from the side and press against the president’s face in what looks like a sudden shove.\nMacron appears momentarily surprised but quickly regains his composure and waves to the press outside.\nAs the couple descend the steps, Macron offers Brigitte his arm, which she does not take, opting instead to hold the railing.\nThe Élysée initially denied the incident on the plane, before later moving to downplay its significance.\nThe couple were merely bickering, a source close to the president told CNN affiliate BFM TV. It was a “moment of togetherness,” according to an Élysée source.\n“It was a moment when the president and his wife were unwinding one last time before the trip began, playfully teasing each other,” the source told CNN Monday.\n“No more was needed to feed the mills of the conspiracy theorists,” the source added, saying pro-Russian trolls were quick to spin the moment into controversy.\nMacron has been at the forefront of efforts to agree a coordinated European response to defending Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.\nThe incident in Hanoi comes as Macron faces another swirl of online disinformation. Earlier this month the Élysée dismissed as “fake news” a viral claim - amplified by Kremlin officials - that the French president was using cocaine aboard a train to Kyiv alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nThe rumor, traced back to pro-Russian accounts, falsely claimed a crumpled tissue Macron picked up was a cocaine bag. The Élysée posted arebuttalonline with the caption: “This is a tissue. For blowing your nose… When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation makes a simple tissue look like drugs.”\nThe Kremlin’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova fueled the claim, suggesting the scene was part of a wider European dysfunction. French officials condemned the campaign as part of ongoing efforts by Moscow to weaken Western unity on Ukraine and manipulate peace discussions through false narratives and social media manipulation."

    "content": "An Austrian appeals court has overturned conservative former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s recent perjury conviction and the resulting eight-month suspended prison sentence, news agency APA reported on Monday.\nThe ruling removes Kurz’s only criminal conviction, taking away a serious obstacle to a future political comeback for the 38-year-old, although prosecutors have yet to decide whether to charge him over potential corruption-related offenses in a separate investigation that forced him from office in 2021.\nThe court was not immediately available for comment. Kurz denies all wrongdoing.\n“I have been confronted with accusations for years. There have been numerous court hearings - a huge amount of confrontation with these accusations. You have all witnessed how much this has been celebrated and that it has now all collapsed,” he said outside the court.\nThe case centered on whether Kurz was merely kept informed of deliberations on the appointment of executives for newly created state holding company OBAG when he was chancellor, or was in fact making the decisions. The appointments were formally his finance minister’s responsibility.\nKurz testified to a parliamentary commission of inquiry in 2020 that he was “involved in the sense of informed.” The judge who heard the case at first instance ruled that was not true and Kurz played an active role.\n“What has come out is what I have always said, namely that I did not tell any untruths in the committee of inquiry,” Kurz said.\nKurz has left the Austrian People’s Party (OVP) and quit politics but some individuals within the OVP hope he will return if there is a change of party leadership, even though polling suggests the majority of Austrians do not want him to stage a comeback.\nKurz led his party to election victories in 2017 and 2019 by adopting a hard line on immigration similar to that of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which won the last parliamentary election in September.\nHe now works as a consultant and tech entrepreneur and says he is happy in his new career.\nHaving come second in the last election, the OVP leads the current three-party centrist coalition government headed by OVP Chancellor Christian Stocker."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/24/europe/russia-ukraine-kyiv-attack-prisoner-swap-intl-hnk",
    "content": "Russia launched its largest aerial assault of its three-year war on Ukraine overnight, targeting the capital and other regions with missiles and drones for a second night in a row, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to rebuke the US for its “silence.”\nAt least 12 people were killed in the attacks across Ukraine, including children, officials said. Dozens more people were injured.\nAmong those killed were three children from the same family in the Zhytomyr region – west of Kyiv – according to Ukraine’s internal affairs minister Ihor Klymenko. He said their parents were hospitalized where the mother remains in a serious condition.\nThe children’s school expressed its condolences on Facebook. “We are in pain. The whole school family… We bow our heads in sorrow,” it said.\nRussia has been intensifying its aerial bombardment of Ukraine as international pressure mounts on Putin to accept a ceasefire proposal.\n“Each such terrorist attack by Russia is a sufficient reason for new sanctions against Russia. Russia is dragging out this war and continues to kill every day,” Zelensky said in a post on Telegram Sunday morning.\n“The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. America’s silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin,” he continued.\nRelated articleTrump says he is ‘not happy with what Putin is doing’\nLater on Sunday, US President Donald Trump expressed frustration with Putin, saying, “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.”\nSpeaking to reporters on his way back to Washington, D.C., Trump said: “He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time. Always gotten along with him, but he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all.”\nBut Trump also turned his criticism toward Zelensky, saying in a post on Truth Social that the Ukrainian president was “doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”\nTrump’s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, called Russia’s overnight attacks a “clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents.”\nThe assault overnight into Sunday came despite the largest prisoner swap of the war taking place, a rare moment of cooperation in a brutal conflict that shows little sign of ending.\nUkraine’s Air Force said 367 aerial attack weapons - 69 missiles and 298 drones - were launched across 22 locations in Ukraine overnight into Sunday. It added 47 of those missiles and 266 drones were intercepted.\nRussia’s previous record-breaking aerial attack on Ukraine was just last weekend when Russia launched273 drones in one night.\n“A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on social media platform X.\nIn the capital Kyiv, air raid sirens blared for hours and residents were warned to stay in shelters in the early hours of Sunday as officials said the city faced a second night in a row of drone and missiles attacks. Civilian buildings in multiple districts were damaged as Russia mounted an attack using drones and rockets, authorities said.\nThe overnight assault came a day after another wave of Russian attacks, which killed at least 13 people.\nPrisoner swap\nOver 600 Russian and Ukrainian prisoners were exchanged Sunday, the final phase of the 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange the two sides had agreed to - the only significant outcome of the meeting betweenKyiv and Moscow in Istanbullast week.\nRussia’s defense ministry said 303 Russian servicemen were exchanged for the same number of Ukrainian prisoners of war.\nVideos posted to social media by Zelensky and other officials show the hundreds of released Ukrainian men with shaved heads calling their loved ones on the phone whilst draped in Ukrainian flags. One video posted by the country’s ombudsman shows three men enjoying chocolate.\nOver 600 prisoners were released on Saturday and almost 800 people were released on Friday during the initial phases of the swap.\nZelensky said Sunday he was “grateful to the team that worked around the clock to successfully implement this exchange.”\nThe Istanbul meeting was initially proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to a ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyiv’s European allies – which many saw as a clear attempt by the Kremlin leader to distract and delay.\nRelated videoHow Putin is rebranding the failing of Kursk as a sign of strength\nKyiv had hoped those talks would alleviate its casualties, but since then Russia has stepped up its bombardment.\n“Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Zelensky said on Sunday, calling on the US and Europe to impose fresh sanctions.\nUS President Donald Trump has said hewould not join in any new sanctionson Russia because he thought “there’s a chance” of progress, but remarked that could change. He hasalso pointed to potential economic incentivesif the war concludes, but the latest Russian assault will renew the sense among Kyiv and its allies that trade with the US is not high on the list of Putin’s priorities.\nMeanwhile, Russia said that it also was attacked by Ukrainian drones on Sunday.\nRussia’s defense ministry said it intercepted or destroyed around 100 attack drones. Most of those destroyed were over Russia’s central and southern regions, with 13 over the Moscow and Tver regions, the ministry said.\nThe defense ministry a day earlier claimed it had destroyed 94 Ukrainian UAVs over Russian territory, mostly over the Belgorod and Bryansk regions. Some UAVs were also shot down over the Kursk, Lipetsk, Voronezh and Tula regions too, it added.\nThe governor of the Tula region, Dmitry Miliaev, said Saturday three people were injured, including two who were hospitalized.\nThis story has been updated.\nCNN’s Kit Maher, Ivana Kottasová, Kathleen Magramo, Victoria Butenko, Ross Adkin, Kevin Liptak, Jeff Zeleny and Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/25/europe/pope-leo-chinese-catholics-church-intl-hnk",
    "content": "Pope Leo XIV asked Sunday for prayers for China’s Catholics to be in communion with the Holy See, as he made his first public remarks about one of the thorniest foreign policy issues facing his new pontificate.\nHistory’s first American pope recalled that on Saturday the Catholic Church marked a special feast day to pray for the church in China. Pope Benedict XVI had initiated the feast day as part of his efforts to unify China’s estimated 12 million Catholics who were divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn’t recognize papal authority, and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution.\nLeo noted that on the feast day “in the churches and shrines in China and throughout the world, prayers have been raised to God as a sign of the solicitude and affection for Chinese Catholics and their communion with the universal church.”\nSpeaking from his studio window during his noontime blessing, Leo prayed that Catholics in China and elsewhere “obtain the grace to be strong and joyful witnesses of the Gospel, even in the midst of trials, to always promote peace and harmony.”\nPope Francistook Benedict’s unifying efforts further by approving acontroversial dealin 2018 over bishop nominations. The details of the deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.\nThe deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing’s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and it has been renewed periodically since then.\nLeo will have to decide whether to continue renewing the accord. There have been some apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.\nLeo told the archbishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Stephen Chow, that he had “visited China several times and got to know the Chinese culture and reality,” according to the Fides missionary news agency, citing comments Chow made in his diocesan weekly newsletter after the conclave.\nChow added that he expected Leo would follow Francis’ direction for the church in China. He said he had given Leo a small statue of Our Lady of Sheshan, a statue of the Madonna that is particularly venerated by Chinese faithful and is celebrated on the feast day, May 24.\nChow, a Jesuit, said he had implored Leo “to not forget the church in China and the Chinese people,” according to the newsletter. “He nodded his head to indicate that he will not forget,” according to Fides.\nThe Vatican has been working for years to try to improve relations with China that were officially severed over seven decades ago when the Communists came to power. Relations had long been stymied over China’s insistence on its exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican insisted on the pope’s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.\nThe 2018 deal was aimed at uniting the flock, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren’t recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican."

    "content": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff has told CNN that a ceasefire-hostage deal for Gaza is currently on the table with a pathway to end the war, and urged Hamas to accept it.\nThe proposal would see the release of half of the living hostages and half of those who have died in exchange for a temporary ceasefire before negotiations begin for a comprehensive agreement to end the war.\nHe declined to specify how long that temporary truce would last, which has been a key issue in the negotiations.\n“Israel will agree to a temporary ceasefire/hostage deal that would see half of the living and half of the deceased return and lead to substantive negotiations to find a path to a permanent ceasefire, which I have agreed to preside over,” Witkoff told CNN on Monday. “That deal is on the table. Hamas should take it.”\nHe said Hamas has yet to accept the deal.\nReuters reported earlier on Monday that Hamas had agreed to a proposal that would see the release of 10 hostages in two groups in exchange for a 70-day truce. Witkoff told CNN that was not his proposal.\n“What I have seen is completely unacceptable,” Witkoff said, referring to the report.\nMeanwhile, a Palestinian official close to the negotiations also told CNN that Hamas has agreed to Witkoff’s proposal, but did not provide additional details about what the deal entailed.\nA US official told CNN Witkoff has not met directly with Hamas. According to a source familiar with the matter, Palestinian-American businessmanBishara Bahbahmet with Hamas in Doha about the proposal. Bahbah, who led the group “Arab Americans for Trump” during the 2024 presidential campaign, has been working on behalf of the administration.\nWitkoff’s comments to CNN mark the first time he has said he would preside over negotiations for an end to the war during the temporary ceasefire.\nRelated articleAmerican charged with plot to throw Molotov cocktails at US embassy office in Israel\nHamas has long sought assurances that Israel seriously engages in negotiations to end the war if it agrees to another temporary ceasefire, after Israel refused to do so during the last truce. Witkoff’s involvement in negotiating a permanent ceasefire appears to be aimed at providing Hamas with assurances from Washington that Israel will engage in such negotiations in the future.\nCNN has reached out to the Israeli government for comment.\nIn a video message posted to social media on Monday night, Netanyahu said getting the hostages released is a top priority.\n“I very much hope we’ll have something to announce on that front,” he said. “And if not today, then tomorrow – we are not giving up.”\nTwo Israeli officials later clarified that there was “no progress” in the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal and that “Hamas continued to hold firm in its refusal.”\n“The prime minister meant that a breakthrough could happen only if Hamas aligns with the Israeli position,” one of the officials said.\nPlans for an ‘unprecedented attack’\nThe proposal comes at a crucial point in the war, as the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for most of southern Gaza ahead of what its spokesperson said would be an “unprecedented attack” on the territory.\nThe order covers the city of Khan Younis and much of the surrounding area, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic language spokesperson Avichay Adree. He described the Khan Younis governorate as a “dangerous fighting zone that has been warned several times.”\nThe evacuation zone goes all the way south to the Gaza-Egypt border where Israeli forces have occupied the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8-mile) strip along the frontier. It appears to include the entirety of Khan Younis, a densely packed city with many displaced Palestinians. The order instructs Palestinians to move to the Al-Mawasi area, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea.\nEarlier Monday, the IDF said three rockets were fired from southern Gaza, two of which landed within the Gazan territory and one of which was intercepted.\nThe order, which also cover parts of eastern Gaza, comes after the military laid out its strategy to take control of the territory, where it has been fighting a war since October 2023 to eradicate Hamas following the militant group’s attack on Israel.\nAn Israeli military official told CNN on Monday that Israel plans to occupy 75% of Gaza within two months as part of its new offensive.\nIf carried out, the plan would force more than two million Palestinians into a quarter of the coastal enclave, surrounded on nearly all sides by Israeli forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this month the entire population would bedisplaced to southern Gaza.\nRelated article‘Every time, I was sure this was the end’: Former IDF hostage in Gaza says one of her biggest fears was Israeli strikes\nThe IDF now has five divisions operating in Gaza, the military said Friday, totaling tens of thousands of troops. On a visit to troops in Khan Younis Sunday, IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said, “You are fighting on the central front of the state of Israel. This is a prolonged, multi-arena war.”\nOn Monday, Hamas’ Government Media Office said Israel already “effectively” controls 77% of Gaza through “heavy firepower that prevents Palestinian civilians from accessing their homes, areas, lands, and properties, or through oppressive forced evacuation policies.”\nIsrael is under growing international pressure – including from long standing allies – over its decision to expand the war and, in the words of one Israeli minister, “conquer” the territory.\nThe United Kingdom has paused trade talks andsanctioned extremist settlersin the West Bank. Canada and France have threatened sanctions. And the European Union – Israel’s biggest trade partner – is reviewing its landmark Association Agreement with the country.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz told German public broadcaster ARD on Monday that the actions of the Israeli military in Gaza “can no longer be justified on the grounds of a fight against Hamas terrorism.”\nUS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, however, reiterated US support for Israel on Sunday.\nShemet with Netanyahuand expressed appreciation for the prime minister’s conduct of the war, according to a statement from the Israeli Government Press Office.\nCNN’s Dana Karni, Lauren Izso and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report."

Kennedy airport in New York after being deported from Israel to the US, according to a Justice Departmentnews release.\nThe DOJ says Neumeyer, who is also a German citizen, had allegedly arrived at the US embassy office in Tel Aviv on May 19 and spat on an embassy guard without provocation.\nNeumeyer managed to break free as the guard attempted to detain him, leaving behind his backpack, the DOJ said, citing a complaint.\nGuards found three Molotov cocktails in the backpack, the department said. Law enforcement tracked down Neumeyer to his hotel in Israel, where he was arrested.\nAuthorities searched Neumeyer’s social media, which allegedly included a post from earlier that day that said “join me as I burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv.” His page also allegedly included the phrases, “Death to America, death to Americans” and threats to assassinate US President Donald Trump.\n“This defendant is charged with planning a devastating attack targeting our embassy in Israel, threatening death to Americans, and President Trump’s life,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi.\nFBI Director Kash Patel said: “This despicable and violent behavior will not be tolerated at home or abroad, and the FBI, working with our partners, will bring him to face justice for his dangerous actions.”\nNeumeyer had allegedly arrived in Israel last month.

    "content": "An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier released during a ceasefire-hostage deal has said one of her biggest fears during captivity were strikes carried out by Israel.\nNa’ama Levy, one of five IDF female soldiers released in January, made the comments during a weekly rally at Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square on Sunday demanding the return of hostages.\n“They (strikes) come unexpectedly. At first you hear the whistles, you pray that it won’t fall on us, and then – the explosions, a noise so loud that it paralyzes the body, and the ground shakes,” Levy told a crowd of thousands.\n“Every time, I was sure that this was the end of me. It was one of the scariest things I experienced there and that’s also what endangered me more than anything,” she continued, describing an incident where a strike caused the house she was in to partially collapse.\n“That was my reality. It’s their reality now,” she said, referring to those still in captivity.\n“Even now, at this very moment, there are hostages who hear those whistles and explosions, they’re there trembling with fear. They have nowhere to run, only to pray and cling to the walls with a terrible feeling of helplessness.”\nThe comments from Levy come as the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza intensify their criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and as Israel comesunder growing pressureto end the war in Gaza.\nEarlier this month, Netanyahu said that defeating Israel’s enemies is the “supreme objective” andmore important than securing the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza– drawing backlash from representatives of hostage families.\nLevy urged for the return of all Israeli hostages, saying there will be “no victory” otherwise.\n“There’s no way in (Israel) they really understand what we’re going through and are still leaving us in Gaza.”\nIn the early months of the war, another Israeli hostage expressed similar fears of being killed by Israeli strikes, Israeli media outletYnet reported, based on audio it said was leaked from a meeting between released hostages, their families, and Netanyahu.\nThe fear was that “it would not be Hamas, but Israel, that would kill us, and then they would say Hamas killed you,” said the hostage, who was released in one of the first deals.\nLevy’s comments on Sunday also came after Netanyahuappointed a new chieffor the country’s Shin Bet security agency on Friday, Maj. Gen David Zini, who has reportedly voiced opposition to hostage deals. The families of hostages have blasted the choice.\nAccording to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Zini said in meetings of IDF general staff: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war.” The report does not provide a specific date for Zini’s comments. Channel 12 says it was a position he repeated often over the past year.\n“If the report is accurate, these are shocking statements, worthy of unequivocal condemnation, especially coming from someone who is expected to hold the fate of the hostages in his hands,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement at the time.\nIn his previous position as the head of the Training Command and General Staff Corps in the IDF, Zini had little influence on hostage negotiations. But as head of the Shin Bet, he could have a significant role considering the agency’s participation in previous rounds of indirect negotiations with Hamas.\n“Appointing a Shin Bet chief who prioritizes (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s war over the return of the hostages is a sin upon a crime and an injustice to the entire people of Israel - a blow to the value of solidarity and the sacred duty to leave no one behind,” the forum said.\nIn recent weeks, Israel has comeunder growing pressureto end the war in Gaza as the enclave faces widespread starvation amid a severe shortage of humanitarian aid.\nThe United Kingdom has paused trade talks andsanctioned extremist settlersin the West Bank. Canada and France have threatened sanctions. And the European Union – Israel’s biggest trade partner – is reviewing its landmark Association Agreement with the country. In the words of one Israeli minister, their patience has worn thin over Israel’s decision to expand the war.\nThe kidnapping of Levy emerged as one of the first to make headlines as the Hamas-led October 7 attack unfolded.\nVideo released by Hamas showed Levy, who was aged 19 at the time, being dragged by her hair at gunpoint with her hands bound."

    "content": "Dr. Alaa al-Najjar left her ten children at home on Friday when she went to work in the emergency room at theNasser Medical Complexin southern Gaza.\nHours later, the bodies of seven children - most of them badly burned - arrived at the hospital, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. They were Dr. Najjar’s own children, killed in an Israeli airstrike on her family’s home, Gaza Civil Defense said. The bodies of two more of her children – a 7-month-old and a 12-year-old who authorities presume to be dead – remain missing.\nOnly one of her ten children, 11-year-old Adam, survived. Dr. Najjar’s husband Hamdi, himself a doctor, was also badly injured in the strike.\nCivil defense and the health ministry say that the family’s home, in a neighborhood ofKhan Younisin southern Gaza, was targeted by an Israeli airstrike.\nIn response to a CNN request for comment, the Israeli military said aircraft had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.” It said it was reviewing the claim civilians had been killed.\nIsrael’s military chief Eyal Zamir went to Khan Younis on Sunday, according to a statement from the IDF.\n“Hamas is under immense pressure—it has lost most of its assets and its command and control. We will deploy every tool at our disposal to bring the hostages home, dismantle Hamas, and dismantle its rule,” Zamir told troops, adding that the the military needs to now take down Hamas’ Khan Younis brigade.\nGaza Civil Defense published graphic video from the scene of the strike. It showed medics lifting an injured man onto a stretcher as other first responders try to extinguish a fire engulfing the house. They recover the charred remains of several children from the debris and wrap them in white sheets.\nDr. Sahar al-Najjar, a niece, told CNN that Hamdi, 38, had dropped his wife at the hospital and gone to get food for his children. When he returned, he witnessed a missile strike on their home that failed to detonate. He rushed inside to rescue his children but was hit by a second Israeli strike.\n“My father went to rescue Uncle Hamdi but found Adam on the street and took him to the hospital. Uncle Hamdi was taken by civil defense, and the rest of the children were all charred,” she said.\nLast bottle of milk\nSahar said Dr. Alaa broke down when she showed the last bottle of breast milk she had expressed for her infant daughter, Sidra, whose body remains missing.\n“She told me today that her chest aches so much as she was breastfeeding,” Sahar said on Sunday. “Every day at work, Dr. Alaa pumped milk to provide for Sidra, and today she showed me the last bottle she prepared for her.”\n“Dr. Alaa can barely speak. If you could see her face, you would understand her pain. She is only praying for her son and husband to recover.”\nWhen Adam, the sole surviving child, came out of the operating room, he called out for his sister Eve, saying, “There’s blood on the tree.” One of Adam’s arms is severely injured, and he will need another surgery in a few days. His father, Hamdi, remains in critical condition.\nIn a condolence message to Dr. Najjar, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said she will always be remembered as “the steadfast Palestinian woman and the noble doctor who heals the wounds of others while bearing her own pain in silence.”\n“This horrific crime is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic targeting of medical personnel and institutions, aimed at breaking the will of those standing steadfast in Gaza,” it said.\n‘Wiping out entire families’\nMunir al-Boursh, Director-General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said that Dr. Najjar’s husband had just returned home when the home was struck.\n“Nine of their children were killed: Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman, and Sidra,” Boursh posted on X.\n“This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain. In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted—Israel’s aggression goes further, wiping out entire families,” Boursh said.\nRelated video‘His death broke us:’ A girl’s life under siege\nAhmad al-Farra, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex, told CNN that Dr. Najjar continued to work despite losing her children, while periodically checking on the condition of her husband and Adam.\nYoussef Abu al-Reesh, a senior official at the Health Ministry, said Dr. Najjar had left her children at home to “fulfill her duty and her calling toward all those sick children who have no place but Nasser Hospital.”\nReesh said that when he arrived at the hospital, he had seen her “standing tall, calm, patient, composed, with eyes full of acceptance. You could hear nothing from her but quiet murmurs of (glorification of God) and (seeking forgiveness).”\nDr. Najjar, 38, is a pediatrician, but like most doctors in Gaza, she has been working in the emergency room during Israel’s onslaught on the territory.\nAs southern Gaza comes under renewed attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday that two of its team members were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis on Saturday.

    "content": "Iran and the United States concluded a fifth round ofhigh-stakes nuclear talksin Rome on Friday amid growing skepticism in Tehran about the chances of a deal as Washington hardens its position.\nA senior Trump administration official said Friday more talks are needed and both sides agreed to meet “in the near future.”\n“The talks continue to be constructive – we made further progress,” the official said, “but there is still work to be done.” The US side said the discussions, which was attended by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, lasted more than two hours.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday’s nuclear talks with the US “are too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings.” He said however that Iran and US delegations “have completed one of the most professional rounds of negotiations,” in a televised interview on state-run IRIB news.\nTwo Iranian sources have told CNN the talks seem unlikely to lead to an agreement, with the US insisting that Tehran dismantles its uranium enrichment program – a demand Iranian officials say wouldcause the nuclear negotiations to collapse.\nRelated video‘It’s going to fail’: Iranians speak to CNN ahead of US-Iran talks\nThe sources said Iran’s participation in the Rome talks was solely to gauge Washington’s latest stance rather than pursue a potential breakthrough.\nAraghchi reiterated Tehran’s red lines before he departed for Rome on Friday.\n“Figuring out the path to a deal is not rocket science,” he posted on X before his flight. “Zero nuclear weapons = we DO have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal.”\nThe Trump administration has demanded Iran stop all uranium enrichment activity, whichWitkoffsays “enables weaponization.” Uranium, a key nuclear fuel, can be used to build a bomb if enriched to high levels. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful and says it is willing to commit not to enrich uranium to weapons-grade as part of an agreement.\nAraghchi met on Friday with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi in Rome “during the continuation of this round of talks,” and the two ministers “reviewed the latest status of today’s talks and consulted on how to continue the work,” Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n“The time and place of the next round of talks will be determined and announced later,” the statement added. US officials have yet to comment publicly on the outcome of Friday’s talks.\nAl-Busaidi, who mediated the talks, said, “We hope to clarify the remaining issues in the coming days, to allow us to proceed towards the common goal of reaching a sustainable and honourable agreement,” in a post on X on Friday.\nIran preparing for ‘Plan B’\nOn Saturday, a senior Iranian lawmaker told CNN that Tehran is disappointed with the progress of nuclear talks and is considering a “Plan B” if they fail – though he did not specify what it would entail.\n“We do not have hope yet, because the American side is still insisting on zero enrichment and I know the Islamic Republic of Iran will never agree with zero enrichment,” Ebrahim Rezaei, a member of the parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said in an interview at the Iranian parliament Saturday. “I got disappointed and do not have much hope that the negotiations will lead to a deal. We are preparing for plan B.”\nRezaei said it was too early to judge whether the talks could succeed. “So far we have not seen much seriousness on their (US’) part,” he added.\nSpeaking Thursday, Araghchi said Iran was open to enhanced monitoring by international inspectors but would not relinquish its right to pursue nuclear energy, including uranium enrichment. Washington is offering to wind back crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for de-nuclearization.\nThe US had previouslysent mixed signalsabout whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium, but in recent weeks it has hardened its stance, insisting that no enrichment will be permitted.\nThat shift has prompted officials in Tehran to question Washington’s commitment to a deal, as Iran has repeatedly said enrichment is a red line in negotiations.\nThe two Iranian sources told CNN that Tehran harbors mounting doubts about the US’ sincerity in talks.\nRelated articleIran’s supreme leader says US-Iran talks unlikely to succeed\n“The media statements and negotiating behavior of the United States has widely disappointed policy-making circles in Tehran,” the sources said in a joint message. “From the perspective of decision-makers in Tehran, when the US knows that accepting zero enrichment in Iran is impossible and yet insists on it, it is a sign that the US is fundamentally not seeking an agreement and is using the negotiations as a tool to intensify pressure.”\nInitially, the sources noted, some Iranian officials believed Washington might seek a “win-win” compromise. However, a consensus has emerged that the Trump administration is steering discussions toward a deadlock.\nThe sources said that although neither the US nor Iran wants to leave the negotiating table, the position of the US is making the talks unproductive and formal meetings are unlikely to continue much longer.\nThey said that Tehran no longer takes seriously US efforts to distance itself from Israel’s hardline stance on Iran, and it sees proposals made by the American side as following the agenda of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has insisted that no enrichment be allowed in Iran.\nWitkoff on Friday met with Ron Dermer, a confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Rome on the sidelines of talks, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.\nUS imposes more sanctions before talks\nWashington has kept up the pressure on Iran with fresh sanctions and threats of war even as diplomatic talks continue.\nOn Wednesday, the US State Department announced new measures, identifying Iran’s construction sector as being “controlled directly or indirectly” by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and 10 strategic materials that it said Iran is using in connection with its nuclear, military or ballistic missile programs.\n“With these determinations, the United States has broader sanctions authorities to prevent Iran from acquiring strategic materials for its construction sector under IRGC control and its proliferation programs,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.\nIran’s foreign ministry spokesperson criticized US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the move, calling it “as outrageous as it is unlawful and inhuman.”\n“The US’s consecutive rounds of sanctions only reinforce our people’s deeply held belief that the American decision makers are set to make every malign effort to hinder Iran’s development & progress. These sanctions, announced on the eve of the fifth round of Iran-US indirect talks, further put to question the American willingness & seriousness for diplomacy,” Baqaei wrote on X.\nA ‘misreading of Iranian psychology’\nAli Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said there is a misguided perception in Washington that a weakened Iran is more likely to compromise.\n“The weaker Iran is, the more reluctant it will be to make major concessions,” he said, adding that it is unlikely that Tehran will agree to a deal that is based solely on US terms.\n“That’s a complete misreading of Iranian psychology,” Vaez said. For Iran, capitulation is seen as a worse than an Israeli strike on its nuclear facilities, he added.\n“Iran would be reluctant to make concessions from a position of weakness, because if it does so, then it will put itself on a slippery slope that could result in regime collapse,” Vaez said.\nMultiple American officialstold CNN this weekthat the US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities even as the Trump administration pursues a diplomatic deal with Tehran.\nRelated articleNew intelligence suggests Israel is preparing possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, US officials say\nBut threats of war will only lead to Iran “doubling down on its current position,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at London’s Chatham House think tank, told CNN. “The best way to invigorate the talks would be through backchannelling and quiet discussions between both sides.”\nIn an interview with CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Thursday, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee signaled potential American support for Israel’s nuclear plans under the right conditions.\n“I can’t imagine the US would object to a sovereign nation defending itself against what they perceive as a legitimate threat to their very lives,” Huckabee said.\nHe acknowledged that the US is aware Israel is making preparations for potential military action.\n“We certainly are aware of what the Israelis are at least preparing for. But it’s not that they have made a firm decision. I think they recognize they face an existential threat from Iran.”\nExperts say an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would likely spell the end of its negotiations with the US, and could even prompt Tehran to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which promotes nuclear disarmament.\nTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said the Trump administration has “unnecessarily walked themselves into a dead-end by insisting on zero enrichment,” fueling the idea that Israeli strikes will follow if Iran doesn’t back down. Iran, he added, is probably not taking those threats seriously.\nBut if they do materialize in the midst of nuclear talks with the US, he said, Tehran is likely to respond with massive retaliation. “They won’t play the patience game any longer,” Parsi said.\n“If the Israelis were to do anything, it has to be clearly understood that it is not about destroying the program at this point, because they don’t have that capability.” Parsi added. “It is only about destroying diplomacy.”\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nCNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim, Angus Watson, Mostafa Salem, Alex Marquardt , Kylie Atwood ,Katrina Samaan and Leila Gharagozlou contributed to this report."

    "content": "The families ofIsraeli hostages held in Gazablasted the newly-picked head of the Shin Bet security agency after he reportedly voiced opposition to hostage deals.\nAccording to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Maj. Gen. David Zini said in meetings of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) general staff: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war.” The report does not provide a specific date for the Zini’s comments. Channel 12 says it wasa position he repeated oftenover the past year.\nRelated articleIsrael is facing unprecedented pressure from allies over its war on Gaza. Can they force it to change its ways?\n“If the report is accurate, these are shocking statements, worthy of unequivocal condemnation, especially coming from someone who is expected to hold the fate of the hostages in his hands,” said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in a statement on Friday.\nIn his current position as the head of the Training Command and General Staff Corps in the IDF, Zini has little influence on hostage negotiations and his personal beliefs are largely irrelevant to the process. But if confirmed ashead of the Shin Bet, Zini could have a significant role considering the agency’s participation in previous rounds of indirect negotiations with Hamas.\n“Appointing a Shin Bet chief who prioritizes (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s war over the return of the hostages is a sin upon a crime and an injustice to the entire people of Israel - a blow to the value of solidarity and the sacred duty to leave no one behind,” the forum said.\nWhen asked for comment, the IDF said it “does not on comment on content discussed in General Staff deliberations.”\nZini’s career in the military has mostly been as a field officer with little experience in intelligence, which is a core aspect of the Shin Bet, officially called the Israel Security Agency.\nRuby Chen, the father of Israeli-American soldierItay Chen, whose body is still held in Gaza, said on social media that “Netanyahu appoints to key positions people who lack the relevant skills in order to control the system.”\nNetanyahu announced Zini’s nomination on Thursday, one day after Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that he had a conflict of interest in firing the previous Shin Bet chief,Ronen Bar, and could not appoint a replacement.\nRelated articleIsraeli Supreme Court freezes Netanyahu government’s dismissal of head of internal security agency\nIn its decision, the court said the firing “was made when the Prime Minister had a conflict of interest in light of the investigations into the affairs of his associates; that the decision was made without a factual foundation; and without a proper hearing being held for the Shin Bet head.”\nOn Thursday, the Attorney General said: “The Prime Minister acted contrary to legal guidance, there is serious concern that he acted when he is in a conflict of interest, and the appointment process is flawed.”\nBut Netanyahu proceeded with the appointment anyway. The Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement on Friday defending the decision. “This is an urgent security necessity, and any delay harms the security of the state and the safety of our soldiers,” it said. Netanyahu said on Friday that he has known Zini for years.\nThe choice of Zini as an active-duty general was also unprecedented, prompting the IDF’s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir to issue a statement saying that Zini would retire “in the upcoming days” before he can take up the civilian Shin Bet post.\nThe pick appeared to surprise the country’s top general, who emphasized that “any discourse conducted by IDF soldiers with the political echelon must be approved by the Chief of General Staff.”"

    "content": "(Reuters) –The United States said on Thursday it would impose sanctions on Sudan after determining that its government used chemical weapons in 2024 during the army’s conflict with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a charge the army denied.\nMeasures against Sudan will include limits on US exports and US government lines of credit and will take effect around June 6, after Congress was notified on Thursday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.\n“The United States calls on the Government of Sudan to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations under the CWC,” Bruce said, referring to the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty banning the use of such weapons.\nIn a statement, Sudan rejected the move, and described the allegations as false.\n“This interference, which lacks any moral or legal basis, deprives Washington of what is left of its credibility and closes the door to any influence in Sudan,” government spokesperson Khalid al-Eisir said on Friday.\nThe war in Sudan erupted in April 2023 from a power struggle between the army and the RSF, unleashing waves of ethnic violence, creating the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and plunging several areas into famine. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and about 13 million displaced.\nWashington in January imposed sanctions on army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, accusing him of choosing war over negotiations to bring an end to the conflict.\nRelated videoTwo years of war, no end in sight: How Sudan’s civil war has ‘metastasized’\nThe US has also determined members of the RSF and allied militias committedgenocideand imposed sanctions on some of the group’s leadership, including RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.\nThe New York Times reported in January, citing four senior US officials, that the Sudanese army had used chemical weapons at least twice during the conflict, deploying the weapons in remote areas of the country.\nTwo officials briefed on the matter said the chemical weapons appeared to use chlorine gas, which can cause lasting damage to human tissue, the New York Times reported at the time.\nBruce’s statement said the US had formally determined on April 24 under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 that the government of Sudan used chemical weapons last year, but did not specify what weapons were used, precisely when or where.\n“The United States remains fully committed to hold to account those responsible for contributing to chemical weapons proliferation,” Bruce said.\n“The intention here is to distract from the recent campaign in Congress against the UAE,” a Sudanese diplomatic source said.\nThe source said the US could have gone to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to investigate the claims and neglected to do so.\nSudan’s government is aligned with the army.\nIt cut diplomaticrelations with the UAEthis month, saying the Gulf power was aiding the RSF with supplies of advanced weaponry in the devastating conflict that broke out following disagreements over the integration of the two forces.\nThe UAE has denied the allegations and says it supports humanitarian and peace efforts.\nUS congressional Democrats sought last Thursday to block arms sales to the United Arab Emirates over its alleged involvement in the war.\nSudan said this week that the United Arab Emirates was responsible for an attack on Port Sudan this month, accusing the Gulf state for the first time of direct military intervention in the war.\nThe UAE denied the allegations in a statement and said it condemned the attack."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/22/africa/south-africa-white-farmers-trump-congo-intl-latam",
    "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump showed a screenshot of Reuters video taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo as part of what hefalsely presented on Wednesdayas evidence of mass killings of white South Africans.\n“These are all white farmers that are being buried,” said Trump, holding up a print-out of an article accompanied by the picture during acontentious Oval Office meetingwith South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nIn fact, the video, published by Reuters on February 3 and subsequently verified by the news agency’s fact check team, showed humanitarian workers lifting body bags in the Congolese city of Goma. The image was pulled from Reuters footage shot following deadly battles with Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.\nThe blog post showed to Ramaphosa by Trump during the White House meeting was published by American Thinker, a conservative online magazine, about conflict and racial tensions in South Africa and Congo.\nThe post did not caption the image but identified it as a “YouTube screen grab” with a link to a video news report about Congo on YouTube, which credited Reuters.\nRelated videoAmanpour asks South African official about the video Trump played in the Oval Office\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. Andrea Widburg, managing editor at American Thinker and the author of the post in question, wrote in reply to a Reuters query that Trump had “misidentified the image.”\nShe added, however, that the post, which referred to what it called Ramaphosa’s “dysfunctional, race-obsessed Marxist government”, had “pointed out the increasing pressure placed on white South Africans.”\nThe footage from which the picture was taken shows a mass burial following an M23 assault on Goma, filmed by Reuters video journalist Djaffar Al Katanty.\n“That day, it was extremely difficult for journalists to get in… I had to negotiate directly with M23 and coordinate with the ICRC to be allowed to film,” Al Katanty said. “Only Reuters has video.”\nAl Katanty said seeing Trump holding the article with the screengrab of his video came as a shock.\n“In view of all the world, President Trump used my image, used what I filmed in DRC to try to convince President Ramaphosa that in his country, white people are being killed by Black people,” Al Katanty said.\nRamaphosa visited Washington this week to try to mend ties with the United States after persistent criticism from Trump in recent months over South Africa’s land laws, foreign policy, andalleged bad treatmentof its white minority, which South Africa denies.\nTrump interrupted the televised meeting with Ramaphosa to play a video, which he said showed evidence of genocide of white farmers in South Africa. This conspiracy theory, which has circulated in far-right chat rooms for years, is based on false claims.\nTrump then proceeded to flip through printed copies of articles that he said detailed murders of white South Africans, saying “death, death, death, horrible death.”"

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/22/africa/ramaphosa-trump-meet-analysis-int",
    "content": "Many South Africans are praising President Cyril Ramaphosa’s calm demeanor as President Donald Trump’smultimedia ambush unfolded in front of the world’s press. He pushed back gently whenever he could, but he didn’t raise his voice or show anger, displaying his decades of negotiation experience.\n“What else could Cyril have done?” asked veteran journalist Milton Nkosi. “You’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I think they were caught completely unawares. How on earth could you have planned for that?” said Nkosi, who’s a senior research fellow at the Africa Asia Dialogues think tank.\nOn social media and across South Africa’s broadcast outlets, consensus seemed to quickly form that Ramaphosa did the best under the circumstances. He remained “calm, collected and humble in the face of bigotry and lies,” postedone user on X. “You were a leader today. Went to build not to fight.”\nRamaphosa brought his own White billionaire to the meeting – luxury goods magnate Johan Rupert, who’s behind brands like Cartier – who told Trump that violent crime affects all races, but his words fell on deaf ears.\nRupert even threw tech billionaire Elon Musk,﻿who was also in the room,a bone.\n“We have too many deaths. But it’s across the board,” Rupert said. “It’s not only White farmers. It’s across the board. We need technological help. We need Starlink at every little police station. We need drones.”\nOne White South African called Ruperta traitorto his fellow Afrikaners in a social media post.\nAnother prominent White South African, agriculture minister John Steenhuisen, also tried to convince their Oval Office host that he had been misled.\nThe most dramatic part of the scene was when Trump called for lights to be dimmed and screened a four-and-a-half minute montage claiming to show evidence of a White genocide. It included far-left opposition leader Julius Malema singing “Kill the Boer, kill the farmer” as a crowd chanted along.\nOfficially named “Dubula iBhunu” in the Xhosa language, the song emerged in the 1980s to fight the unjust system of segregation. South African courts have ruled that it doesn’t mean a literal call to kill White farmers.\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal ruled in 2024 that any “reasonably well-informed person” would see it as a “historic struggle song, with the performance gestures that go with it, as a provocative means of advancing his party’s political agenda.”\nTrump confronted Ramaphosa on why he had not arrested Malema for it.\nMalema, leader of the the Economic Freedom Fighters party, responded in his typical fiery way on X: “A group of older men meet in Washington to gossip about me,” he said, disputing the claims of a genocide. “We will not agree to compromise our political principles on land expropriation without compensation for political expediency.”\nMalema was expelled from Ramaphosa’s African National Congress (ANC) party more than a decade ago and came third in the most recent election.\nMost of the information that Trump used to try to prove that “White genocide” is happening in South Africahas repeatedly been disproven.\nSome South Africans have said that they believe that the information is “AfriForum propaganda” – referring to a White Afrikaner lobby groupcriticized as being a Whitenationalist group.\nIts chief executive told CNN the group was pleased with how the meeting went.\n“It shows that the South African president and the ANC leadership cannot just simply sweep real problems that we have in the country under the carpet and think they will disappear,” Kallie Kriel said in a voice note.\nCNN has looked at data from the South African police and has found no evidence of a “White genocide.” A video played by Trump purported to show thousands of White farmers buried along the side of the road – but Ramaphosa said that he did not recognize the video, and that there was no evidence it showed what Trump claimed it displayed.\nIt was the toughest public test yet for Ramaphosa, a skilled dealmaker who led negotiations for Nelson Mandela in talks that ended apartheid.\n“It is absolutely absurd to sit and watch the president of the most powerful country in the world telling the man who negotiated to end apartheid, who was locked up in solitary confinement, that there’s White genocide in South Africa, which is a lie. That is crazy,” Nkosi told CNN.\nIt was a good day for South Africa’s White nationalists. The president of the United States repeated their talking points from the bully pulpit of the White House, giving them the highest-profile validation they could have ever dreamed of.\nThe South African delegation expected a confrontational meeting, but nothing could have prepared them for the ambush that awaited them."

    "content": "South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa will hold crucial talks at the White House with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday in a high-stakes meeting that could improve or deteriorate already frosty relations between the nations.\nRamaphosa is hopeful his visit could end a diplomatic feud that sparkedaid cancellationsby Trump and fueled theexpulsionof his nation’s ambassador to the US – but some in his country fear the meeting could go off the rails, as it did for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the notoriousOval Office encounterin February.\nThere are also fears that the African nation could now potentially lose some of its US trade privileges as relations between the two countries sour.\nRamaphosa’s trip comes just over a week after a group of 59 White South Africans arrived in the US after being granted refugee status.\nTrump andhis ally Elon Musk, who was born and raised in the country, claimed the South Africans were being persecuted back home. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was in the US national interest to prioritize White South Africans for refugee resettlement, telling a hearing that they’re “a small subset” who “are easier to vet.”\nRubio did not rule out that their race is a factor in the resettlement but argued that they are being “persecuted” for being White.\nThe Trump administration has sharply criticized an expropriation law, which was enacted in South Africa earlier this year, in an attempt to reversehistoric racial inequalities. The law empowers South Africa’s government to take land and redistribute it – with no obligation to pay compensation in some instances – if the seizure is found to be“just and equitable and in the public interest.”\nDuring a discriminatory apartheid government that ended in the mid-1990s, Black South Africans were forcibly dispossessed of their lands for the benefit of Whites. Today, some three decades after the end of apartheid, Blacks, who comprise over 80% of the country’s population of 63 million, own around 4% of private land.\nRelated articleSouth Africa does have a history of racist land inequality. Just not in the way Trump and Musk are portraying\nTrump claimed that lands belonging to minority Whites, whoown 72%of the nation’s agricultural land, were being targeted for confiscation, and cited unverified claims that “a genocide is taking place” in South Africa. Headdedthat “White farmers are being brutally killed” amidreports of farm attacks.\nSouth African authorities have pushed back hard against those claims with police minister Senzo Mchunu saying there was no evidence of a “White genocide” in the country.\nIn a statement in February, the South African Police Service urged the public“to desist from assumptions that belong to the past, where farm murders are the same as murders of white farmers.”\nTrump also disapproves of South Africa’sgenocide casebefore the International Court of Justice against the US ally Israel.\nRamaphosa’s office said he would “discuss bilateral, regional and global issues of interest” with the US president at the White House. Analysts say the meeting could pose a tipping point for their fraught ties.\nThe US is South Africa’s second-largest trading partner, and the African nation benefits the most from a US trade agreement that provides preferential duty-free access to US markets for eligible sub-Saharan African nations.\nUnder that agreement, South Africa is themain agricultural exporterand exports two-thirds of its agricultural goods to the US, tariff-free. But some US lawmakers want those benefits withdrawn when the trade agreement is reviewed this year.\n‘A tricky place to be’\nSouth African researcher Neo Letswalo describes the anticipated meeting as “make-or-break” and one that requires “supreme negotiation tactics” by Ramaphosa.\nThe South African leader is set for a tightrope walk at the White House, he added, reminiscing abouta shouting matchthat broke out in the Oval Office between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine’s Zelensky in late February.\n“Drawing from Zelensky’s meeting with Donald Trump and JD Vance, we know that the Oval Office is currently or at least for the next five years, a tricky place to be,” Letswalo, a research associate at the University of Johannesburg told CNN.\nHe believes that “Ramaphosa would maintain his composure to iron out some of the misunderstandings that Trump’s administration officials have about South Africa.”\nOther analysts, such as Christopher Afoke Isike, who is a professor of African politics and international relations at the University of Pretoria, believe that Ramaphosa can pull through, “considering the fact that he’s a businessman president like President Trump.”\nRamaphosa plans to soften the ground with a potential licensing deal for Starlink, a satellite internet service owned by Musk. His spokesman Vincent Magwenya confirmed to CNN that South Africa has had talks with Starlink about operating in the country.\nThe South African governmentsaid“reframing bilateral, economic and commercial relations” was the specific focus of Ramaphosa’s US visit.\n“We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal,” Ramaphosatold reportersahead of his meeting with Trump.\nSouth African golfer Ernie Els is expected to visit the White House with Ramaphosa’s delegation, according to three US officials familiar with the plans. Musk is also expected to attend the White House meeting, two US officials said.\nBringing one of the most successful golfers in the world into the meeting with Trump, who is an avid golfer himself, might set a positive tone. But some US officials still predict that the meeting could turn into a “nightmare” scenario.\n“It is certainly possible that we see fireworks like we saw in the Zelensky oval office meeting,” said a US official of the Wednesday meeting.\nWhat could go wrong?\nFor Letswalo, the crucial talks between Trump and Ramaphosa could hit a brick wall if the White House makes costly demands.\n“A dealbreaker would be a request by Washington for Pretoria to retrieve the Land Expropriation Act or Gaza Case in order to continue the US-SA relationship,” he said, adding, “it would be interesting to see how President Ramaphosa maintains the sovereignty and his statement of ‘not going to be bullied by America’, without compromising the pre-existing relationship with the US.”\nThat task could be one of Ramaphosa’s most challenging, according to André Duvenhage, a politics professor at South Africa’s Northwest University.\n“This may be his single biggest challenge in terms of anything he had to deal with in his term as president of the Republic of South Africa.”\nCNN’s Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood and Kevin Liptak contributed reporting."

It is unclear how the officials, once elected, plan on running the territory, which Guyana governs.\nThe election is the latest provocation in a long-running territory dispute between Venezuela and Guyana.\nIt comes more than a year after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro ordered the creation of anew statewithin the territory, which is roughly the size of Florida, called “Guayana Esequiba,” following areferendumthat saw Venezuelan voters approving the move.\nGuyana had called Venezuela’s actions a step towards annexation and an “existential” threat as the specter of armedconflict loomed overthe region.\nMaduro first announced in January that a vote would be held for the region as part of a larger election for governors and lawmakers across the country. “I call for freedom of conscience for the people and for the people to elect the best for the governorships of the 24 states,” Maduro said on Telegram ahead of Sunday’s election, referring to Essequibo as the nation’s 24th state.\nRelated articleLeaders of Venezuela and Guyana agree to avoid use of force in land dispute\nThe vote has put Guyana on high alert, with its President Irfaan Ali on Saturday calling the poll “scandalous, false, propagandistic (and) opportunistic.”\nGuyana is home to vast oil reserves and is on track to become the world’s highest per capita oil producer.

    "content": "A popular Mexican singer, Julión Álvarez, says he and his band have had to cancel a show in Texas on Saturday night after the singer’s visa to enter the United States had been allegedly revoked.\nThe band, called Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda, was due to play at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, around 30 miles west of Dallas, for a sold-out concert with nearly 50,000 tickets sold, the artist’s team said in a statement Friday.\nThe artist, show promoter CMN and management company Copar Music said that the show had been cancelled “due to unforeseen circumstances,” and that Álvarez was “unable to enter the United States in time for the event.”\nÁlvarez also announced the news on his Instagram account, saying in a video that he and his team were notified that his work visa had been revoked by US authorities earlier Friday.\n“It is not possible for us to go to the United States and fulfill our show promise with all of you. It’s a situation that is out of our hands. That’s the information I have and what I can share,” he said in the video.\nÁlvarez said the stage had already been built and that his production team was already in Texas preparing for the show.\n“I apologize to all of you, and if God permits, we will be in touch to provide more information,” he said.\nThe show’s promoter and Copar Music said they were working with Álvarez’s team to reschedule the performance. All previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new date and refund details will be provided for those who cannot attend, it said.\nA US State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Álvarez’s case, telling CNN that visa records are confidential and that, by law, they cannot comment on individual cases.\nÁlvarez and his band are the latest Mexican artists to allegedly have their US visas revoked amid Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown.\nRelated articleFirst Trump targeted Mexico’s drug cartels. Now it’s the musicians who sing about them\nLast month, the State Department revoked the tourist visas of members of the Mexican bandLos Alegres del Barranco, after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco.\nThe Trump administration has also cracked down on foreign nationals allegedly linked directly or indirectly to drug cartels. This includes revoking the visas of artists whose work depicts drug cartels that the administration has deemedforeign terrorist organizations.\nIn 2017, Álvarez had his US work visa revoked after the US alleged he and around 20 other people – including soccer player Rafael Márquez – had ties to a drug trafficker linked to major cartels and were put under sanctions, according to a US Treasurystatement.\nÁlvarez denied those allegations and said he was only connected to the trafficker over a real estate purchase.\nÁlvarez was removed from the sanctions list in 2022 and was able to regain his visa, making a return to the United States earlier this year with three sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles in April.\nWith nearly 17 million monthly listenerson Spotify,Álvarez is renowned in Mexico for his traditional music style with elements of banda, norteña, and mariachi. Some of his top hits include heartbreak hits like “Póngamonos de Acuerdo” and “Te Hubieras Ido Antes.”"

    "content": "Award-winning Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado has died, according to his nonprofit Instituto Terra. He was 81 years old.\n“It is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing of Sebastião Salgado, our founder, mentor, and eternal source of inspiration,”Instituto Terrasaid in an Instagram post, which did not list a cause of death.\nSalgado is survived by two sons, two grandchildren and his partner Lélia Deluiz Wanick Salgado, who co-founded the Instituto Terra with him.\n“Sebastião was much more than one of the greatest photographers of our time,” the post continued. “Alongside his life partner, Lélia Deluiz Wanick Salgado, he sowed hope where there was devastation and brought to life the belief that environmental restoration is also a profound act of love for humanity.”\nTrained initially as an economist, Salgado spent much of his long career documenting the effects of heavy industry on the environment, from a monograph ongold miningin his native Brazil to a book onoil firesin Kuwait.\nRelated article‘We must be smart enough to survive’: Photographer Sebastião Salgado sees the bigger picture\nSalgado’s last book, “Amazônia,” showcased Brazil’s region of the same name, focusing on the sustainable example offered by the Amazon’s Indigenous communities and the beauty of its riverine landscape.\n“We are presenting a different Amazonia,” Salgado told CNN in 2021. “There are no fires, no destruction – the Amazonia that must stay there forever.”\n“We cannot build our future – the future of humanity – based only on technology,” Salgado continued. “We must look at our past; we must take into consideration anything that we did in our history. Human beings have a huge opportunity: the prehistory of humanity is in Amazonia now.”\nThe ongoing destruction of the rainforest pained Salgado greatly, and he devoted many years through his nonprofit to planting trees and restoring denuded woodlands in Brazil. In 2021, he told CNN that he and volunteers had planted over 3 million trees over 22 years on his family’s property in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest.\n“We can rebuild the planet that we destroyed, and we must,” Salgado said.\nCNN’s Thomas Page contributed reporting."

    "content": "North Korea has arrested four people it claims bear responsibility for alaunch accidentlast week that leftleader Kim Jong Un’s newest warship lying on its side and partially submerged in a shipyard, state-run media has reported.\nThe four people detained included Ri Hyong Son, vice department director of the Munitions Industry Department of the Party Central Committee, “who was greatly responsible for the occurrence of the serious accident,” a report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Monday said.\nOn Sunday, KCNA said three others had been detained: Kang Jong Chol, chief engineer of the Chongjin Shipyard where the accident occurred, Han Kyong Hak, head of the hull construction workshop, and Kim Yong Hak, deputy manager for administrative affairs.\nKim last week called thebotched launch, which he witnessed, “a criminal act” and vowed to punish those responsible.\nLast Wednesday’s accident resulted from a malfunction in the launch mechanism thatcaused the stern of the as-yet unnamed 5,000-ton destroyer to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull and leaving the bow stranded on the shipway, KCNA reported on Thursday in a rare admission of fault from an otherwise highly secretive state.\nState media reported on Friday that the damage to the warship was less than North Korea’s initial estimate, saying there were no holes in the hull, although it was scratched along the starboard side. It also said “a certain amount of seawater flowed into the stern section.”\nRepairs could take about 10 days, the report said. Though analysts are skeptical.\nKim had ordered the destroyer to be restored before the late June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party, calling the matter one of national honor.\nTarp covers\nSatellite imagery shows most of the warship covered in blue tarps at the launch site, making it difficult for experts to determine the full extent of the damage it suffered.\nBut analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said repair work could take up to six months, well beyond Kim’s June target.\n“If the hull damage extends across the ship’s port side covered by the tarp, then we are looking at four to six months of repair work,” he said.\nRepairs could be complicated depending on the amount of sea water that entered the warship, according to Schuster.\nThe interior of the ship would need to be thoroughly flushed with fresh water and then dried to prevent “salt crust” from forming on metal surfaces, he said.\n“If it gets into joints and things, then it becomes destructive,” Schuster said.\nBut the flushing work cannot begin until the ship is righted and any holes in the hull are patched, he said.\nKCNA reported Monday that “the work for completely restoring the balance of the warship is being actively conducted,” but it did not give a timeline.\nSatellite images from Maxar Technologies taken Sunday and supplied to CNN showed the ship still on its side, still mostly covered in blue tarps as smaller boats swarmed around it.\nSouth Korean lawmaker and defense analyst Yu Yong-weon said last week that rushing the launch of the ship likely led to the problems encountered on Wednesday and warned hasty repairs could cause more problems down the line.\nSchuster echoed that thinking, saying optics may be more important than military value to the Kim regime.\n“If Kim Jong Un says, ‘I want that ship fitted out in six months,’ they’ll take shortcuts to make it happen. And usually when you do that you wind up with a ship that’s not, shall we say optimal for operations? But it meets the propaganda criteria.”\nCNN’s Yoonjung Seo and Gawon Bae contributed to this report."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/22/asia/north-korea-destroyer-accident-intl-hnk-ml",
    "content": "North Korea’s newest warship was severely damaged during a recent launch ceremony, with leader Kim Jong Un, who witnessed the accident, saying it brought shame to the nation’s prestige and vowing to punish those found responsible, state media reported.\nIn a rare admission of failure, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said a malfunction in the launch mechanism caused the stern of the as-yet unnamed 5,000-ton destroyer to slide prematurely into the water on Wednesday, crushing parts of the hull and leaving the bow stranded on the shipway.\nKim called the launch failure “a criminal act” and blamed it on “absolute carelessness” and “irresponsibility” by multiple state institutions - including the Munitions Industry Department, Kim Chaek University of Technology and the central ship design bureau.\nLaw enforcement have detained three people “for legal investigation” over the incident, including the chief engineer of the shipyard, state media KCNA reported Sunday, citing the group in charge of investigating the botched launch.\nSatellite imagery showed the vessel lying on its side, the stern in the water, andthe bow still on land. State media did not immediately release images of the accident.\nNaval analysts said the damage incurred by a vessel in such a launch malfunction could be “catastrophic.”\n“If the ship does not move together, the stresses will tear the hull apart,” Sal Mercogliano, a professor at Campbell University in North Carolina and a maritime expert, told CNN.\nNaval analyst Carl Schuster in Hawaii, after reviewing the KCNA account, said he thinks the stresses would “warp the hull, induce cracks and (possibly) snap the keel depending on where the greatest stress falls.”\nThe launch failure marks a setback for what analysts have viewed as North Korea’s most ambitious naval modernization effort in decades.\nThe ship was to be the second major navy surface vessel revealed in quick succession byNorth Korea. In April, Kim unveiled the Choe Hyon, the country’s first newly constructed destroyer in decades, and declared his ambition of building more destroyers and various cruisers and frigates.\nThe Choe Hyon, described as a “new generation” warship, was presented with significant fanfare with state media saying it would strengthen naval readiness amid what Pyongyang calls rising threats from the United States and South Korea.\nRelated articleNorth Korea is making what could be its largest, most advanced warship ever, new satellite photos show\nWestern defense analysts noted that the Choe Hyon marked a departure from the aging Soviet-era vessels that dominated the Korean People’s Navy. While details remain scarce, satellite imagery and footage suggested the Choe Hyon could share design elements with similar Russian navy ships.\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) spokesperson Lee Sung-joon said the vessel damaged on Wednesday was thought to be equipped like the Choe Hyon.\nWednesday’s incident could cast doubt on the country’s ability to scale its navy. Kim said the damage would be addressed not only through technical repairs, but political accountability.\nHe ordered the destroyer to be restored before the late June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party, calling the matter one of national honor.\nKCNA reported Friday that the damage to the warship was less than North Korea’s initial estimate, saying there were no holes in the hull, although it was scratched along the starboard side. It also said “a certain amount of seawater flowed into the stern section.”\nRepairs could take about 10 days, the report said.\nHowever, considering the potential degree of damage, analysts said that it would be nearly impossible to meet Kim’s late June deadline ﻿for repairs.\nThe ship “will not be entering Korean Peoples’ Navy (KPN) service anytime soon and may ultimately prove to be a complete loss,” experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrotein theirBeyond Parallelblogalongsidesatellite photos of the floundering vessel.\nRetired South Korean Adm. Kim Duk-ki told CNN that North Korea appeared to lack the necessary infrastructure – a dry dock – to launch a 5,000-ton destroyer, let alone recover and repair it.\nA dry dock is a basin facility that can be filled with water to float a ship or drain out to build or repair one.\n“Dry dock is an expensive facility, and North Korea probably doesn’t have one… It’s easy to repair a ship in a dry dock after draining water, but they don’t have the facility,” the retired admiral said, adding that restoration could take over four to five months.\nSouth Korean lawmaker and defense analyst Yu Yong-weon said rushing the launch of the ship likely led to the problems encountered on Wednesday and warned hasty repairs could cause more problems down the line.\nSchuster said repairs, if possible, are more likely to take months, rather than weeks.\nAn accident investigation group has been formed, and senior officials may face censure at the upcoming Party Central Committee meeting, an account from KCNA reported.\nNorth Korea’s navy is often seen as the least developed branch of its military. The hastened pace of destroyer development has surprised some outside observers, raising questions about how much of the technology is functional versus symbolic.\nMercogliano, the US professor, said it’s unclear whether Pyongyang’s new warships even have engines as state media has provided no images of them underway.\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

Dashti said 38 people were wounded in the attack.\n“The bus was carrying Army Public School children,” said Kaleem Ullah, a police official from Khuzdar.\nArmy Public Schools are a network of school across Pakistan for children of military staff.\nAt least three children and two adults were killed, according to a statement from the Pakistan military.\nThere has been no claim of responsibility for the attack so far.\nBalochistan has been rocked for years by aseparatist insurgencythat seeks greater political autonomy and economic development in the strategically important and mineral-rich mountainous region.\nRelated articleDivided by a border, united by fear: Kashmiris pick up the pieces after India-Pakistan step back from the brink\nPakistan’s military accused “Indian proxies” of being behind the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. It did not give evidence for its claims.\nPakistan has previously accused its neighbor and arch-rival of being behind attacks in Balochistan. New Delhi has denied the accusations.\nIndia’s foreign ministry rejected what it described as “baseless allegations” on Wednesday, and accused Islamabad of leveling such claims “to hide its own gross failings.”\n“India condoles the loss of lives in all such incidents,” a spokesperson for the country’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement to CNN.\n“However, in order to divert attention from its reputation as the global epicenter of terrorism and to hide its own gross failings, it has become second nature for Pakistan to blame India for all its internal issues,” the spokesperson added.\nPakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned the cowardly attack” in a statement and repeated the military’s accusations that India was behind the attack.\nIndia has long accused Pakistan of sheltering militant groups that have carried out attacks across the border, including a recent massacre of tourists in India-administered Kashmir, allegations Islamabad has denied.\nTensions between the two spiraled after that massacre and resulted in a brief four-day conflict earlier this month that was the most sustained fighting between the two in decades. A fragile ceasefire has held since then.\nWednesday’s attack comes just over two months after thedeadly hijacking of a trainby separatist militants in Balochistan.\nIn that incident the Baloch Liberation Army took more than 350 people – some of whom were security personnel – hostage, killing 27 of them.\nChildren have also been the target of some of Pakistan’s most devastating terror attacks.\nAt least 145 people, mostly school children, were killedinby Pakistani Taliban militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2014 – the worst terror attack in the country’s history.\nThe Pakistani Taliban’s most notable target was then 15-year-oldMalala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot on October 9, 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls.\nCNN’s Aishwarya S Iyer contributed reporting."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/21/asia/japan-farm-minister-resigns-rice-gaffe-intl-hnk",
    "content": "An off-the-cuff remark about never paying for rice has cost Japan’s agriculture minister his job, as pressure mounts on the government to solve the nation’s rice crisis.\nTaku Eto resigned on Wednesday, telling reporters that he had concluded he was “not the right person for this role” after sparking a public backlash by saying that he had “so much rice at home that (he) could sell it.”\nThe cost of rice – Japan’s prime staple food - has become a major political issue, with prices surging to record highs this year and the government taking the rare steps ofreleasing emergency reservesand importing foreign rice.\nEto’s gaffe could not have come at a worse time forPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’sgovernment, which was already suffering from low approval ratings due to spiraling cost of living, weeks ahead of an election.\n“I have never bought rice myself. Frankly, my supporters give me quite a lot of rice. I have so much rice at home that I could sell it,” Eto said in a speech over the weekend, drawing the ire of the public.\nHe later clarified he did buy his own rice and said he “deeply regretted” his comments.\n“I made an extremely inappropriate remark as the minister responsible. For that, I apologize once again to the people of Japan,” Eto said Wednesday after tendering his resignation.\nHe added that he “fully recognized” the hardship people are facing due to soaring rice prices.\nA major threat\nFrustrations over the rising cost of living in Japan is shaping up to be a major threat for Prime Minister Ishiba and his Liberal Democratic Party as the country heads to the polls for upper house elections in July.\nThe latest approval ratings for Ishiba’s cabinet slipped to 27.4%, a record low, according to a poll by Japanese news agency Kyodo released on Sunday. Almost one in nine of the households surveyed said the government’s efforts to rein in rice prices had been insufficient.\nIshiba’s party, which has ruled Japan for almost all of its post-war history, suffered acrushing defeatin last year’s lower house election, but he held on to power by seeking support from minor parties.\nFurther defeat in the coming elections could threaten his coalition’s rule and spark calls for a new leader.\nRice price stubbornly high\nDespite the government’s attempts to bring them down, rice prices in Japan have remained stubbornly high – almost twice what they were a year ago.\nThe average retail price of rice rose to 4,268 yen ($29.4 US) per five kilograms in the second week of May, reversing a brief decline in 18 weeks recorded in the previous month, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.\nEarlier this year, it took the rare step of putting hundreds of thousands of tons of rice from its emergency reservesup for auction, in a bid to drive down prices. Multiple auctions have since been scheduled until July, with hundreds of thousands of tons of rice being released.\nJapan, which takes deep pride in its homegrown rice, has also scaled up imports of rice from overseas, mainly from the US. In April, it also imported South Korean rice for the first time since 1999.\nDealing with the rice crisis is now the job of Shinjiro Koizumi, a former environment minister and son of a former Japanese Prime Minister, who Ishiba has appointed to head the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.\n“I have instructed Mr. Koizumi to make strong efforts to supply rice to consumers at a stable price, especially in light of the current high rice prices,” Ishiba said."

    "content": "The bucolic, vineyard-dotted Eastern Townships region of southern Quebec has a message for Americans: come hug it out.\nThe region’s tourist board released a promotional video on May 26 portraying an English-speaking tourist who bashfully admits to being American — thengets a big hugfrom a French-speaking hotel receptionist.\nIt’s part of a CA$150,000 (US$109,000) ad campaign timed for the start of the summer travel season and aimed at US vacationers. Isabelle Charlebois, general director ofTourism Eastern Townships, said the video is meant to reassure American visitors that “they are not only expected this summer, but truly welcome.”\nIf travelers need that encouragement, perhaps it’s because amida trade warandrising tensionssome are wondering if it’s the right time to visit Canada.\n“When our administration starts talking about making Canada the 51st state, I could understand if Canadian border patrol might be giving extra scrutiny to Americans,” said Brian Kirchhoff of Middlebury, Vermont.\nWhile he still plans to visit Montreal for next month’sCanadian Grand Prix, Kirchhoff worries escalating rhetoric from the White House will have repercussions for Americans traveling abroad. “I just don’t know what attitudes are going to be as the situation continues to unfold,” he said.\nMelissa Curtin McDavitt, a Fora Travel adviser in Los Angeles, California, was taken aback when clients cited concerns about politics and cancelled a planned girls getaway toQuebec City, a provincial capital that’s among thesafest cities in Canada.\n“I was shocked,” she said. “Like, ‘are you sure?’”\nOther US travelers have beentaking to social media forumsto ask Canadians to weigh in directly. “We don’t want to stir up trouble,”wrote one Americanon Reddit. “Is it appropriate for us to visit?”\nAndrew Siegwart, president and CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario (TIAO), said Canadians working at hotels, resorts and other travel destinations are hearing similar concerns from Americans wondering if they should call off their plans.\n“Our members and operators across the province are fielding these types of questions,” Siegwart said. “Is it going to be seamless to cross the border? Are we really going to be welcome?”\nFrom ‘elbows up’ to ‘arms open’\nSuch hesitations could have a big economic impact in Canada, where Americans made up nearly 79% of international visits in the third quarter of last year. US travelers spent$6.6 billionin the same period, according to Canada’s national statistics office.\n“The US market is a really strong part of the economy,” Siegwart said, noting that as the peak travel season nears, he’s concerned by slowing cross-border travel. US resident trips to Canada sagged in bothFebruaryandMarch, the first year-over-year monthly decreases since 2021.\nAbout a third of TIAO members have reported lower summer-season bookings from American travelers when compared with the same period in 2024, Siegwart said.\n“We’re concerned about the impacts of the trade dispute on travel plans by our US neighbors,” he said.\nLike their counterparts in the Eastern Townships, members of the Ontario tourism industry are inviting Americans to visit — and telling them that they’ll meet witha warm reception.\n“We really are ‘arms open’ to the world and our US visitors,” Siegwart said, using a tagline that riffs on the“elbows up” sloganthat’s a rallying cry for Canadian resistance to Trump’s tariffs. “I’ve heard of a number of destinations in Ontario planning to really roll out the welcome mat.”\nIn western Canada, agroup of tour operatorsspecializing in grizzly bear viewing is launching a “Hey, Neighbor!” campaign this month, featuring small business owners speaking directly to Americans.\n“We’ve been hearing your questions up here in British Columbia. You’re wondering if you’re still welcome,” the video begins. “Come on up. You’re always welcome.”\nOther destinations in Canada are beckoning US travelers with reminders that their budgets go further north of the border. On April 28,Tourisme Montreallaunched a “stretch your dollar” campaign with a real-time ticker tracking the exchange rate between US and Canadian currencies, which is currently very favorable to Americans.\n“In Montreal, we’re privileged to have ties with the United States that are historical, cultural and geographical. This is just a way to encourage that to continue,” said Tourisme Montreal spokesperson Aurélie de Blois. “Montrealers are known for being warm, welcoming and open-spirited, which is not going to change.”\nRelated article‘Am I now a walking target?’: The Canadians boycotting travel to the United States because of Trump\nWhat about everyday Canadians?\nA skeptic might point out that tourism representatives have a vested interest in convincing Americans that Canadians still want them around. Ad campaigns don’t always mirror popular sentiment — and it’s clear that events on the national level have sparked widespread anger in Canada.\nNearly two-thirds of Canadians now see the United States as an “unfriendly” or “enemy” country, according to aYouGov polllast month; the same poll found that 61% are boycotting American companies. This winter, Canadian fans at NHL and NBA games took tobooing the US national anthem.\nBut surging Canadian pride really isn’t hostile to Americans themselves, said Jessica Langer Kapalka, who co-owns Toronto’s Canada-themedGrizzly Bar. (Tagline: Canada’s most Canadian bar and grill.)\n“We welcome Americans as long as they are respectful of our sovereignty and our culture. We aren’t anti-American, we’re pro-Canadian,” Kapalka said.\nAt Grizzly Bar, visitors of all nationalities can enjoy Molson lager and elk-topped poutine in a space decked with portraits of Canadian greats from Celine Dion to David Suzuki.\nPlenty of everyday Canadians say they have no intention of taking out political frustrations on visitors — and some are going the extra mile to be neighborly.\nIn February, Canadian TikToker Tod Maffinposted an open invitationfor Americans supportive of Canada to visit his Vancouver Island hometown of Nanaimo. On April 26, some500 people took him up on it, gathering for group photos with the mayor in Maffeo Sutton Park and nibbling the town’s namesake dessert: Nanaimo bars.\n“It filled my heart,” Maffin said. “When it comes to rank-and-file Americans, nothing has changed with the relationship and love and kinship that Canadians feel with the people across the border.”\nResponses to Americans’ anxious social media queries have been largely friendly, too. Echoing a recurrent theme, one poster suggested that Americanscome, but be sensitive:“Lay off the 51st state ‘jokes’ and you are welcome with open arms. Have fun, enjoy this beautiful country.”\nIn response to the American who asked, on Reddit, if it’s “appropriate” to visit, Blake Smith of Kitchener, Ontario, replied that even Canadians frustrated with US politics don’t have a problem with Americans as people. On a recent phone call, he underscored that perspective.\n“I think your average person in Canada likes to judge individuals by themselves, on their own merit … not as a deep red MAGA Republican or a blue Democrat,” he said, then weighed in with an invitation of his own.\nHe said he hopes Americans whododecide to vacation in Canada can treat it as a break from current events. In Canada, he noted, it’s still considered a bit impolite to talk too much about politics.\n“Leave your troubles at home. Turn off the part of your brain that’s doom scrolling,” he said. “Most people here just want to get along.”"

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/27/travel/southwest-airlines-baggage-fee-price",
    "content": "Southwest Airlines has put a price tag on checking bags, a coveted free perk that isabout to disappearas part of substantial changes the carrier is making to its service.\nFor flights booked on May 28 and after, checking the first bag will cost $35 and $45 for the second piece of luggage. If the ticket was bought prior to Wednesday, the customer will still receive two free checked bags, the company announced.\nThere are some exceptions, however: Members in the A-List tier of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, holders of its branded credit card or those traveling on a business fare will be exempt from the charges.\nSouthwest’s fee are aligned with other carriers’ prices. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines all charge between $35 to $40 for the first checked bag. Others, like JetBlue Airways and Frontier Airlines, charge different feesdepending onvarious factors including if it’s purchased online or departure date.\nSouthwest has always offered free checked bags since the airline started about 60 years ago and kept the policy in place when its competitors starting adding andincreasing fees. In fact, the carrier has trademarked its “bags fly free” slogan, which has been a key part of its advertising.\nAdding these fees will likely instantly boost its bottom line because Southwest has two to three times as many checked bags as other airlines.\nDespite not charging for the first two checked bags, Southwest collected $83 million in baggage fees in 2024, according to Department of Transportationstatistics. (Southwest charges $150 for a third checked bag and up to $200 for overweight luggage among other fees).\nHowever, that is a fraction of the baggage fees collected by other airlines, with American collecting $1.5 billion in 2024, while United pulled in $1.3 billion and Delta garnering $1 billion.\nOther changes\nSouthwest has been under pressure to boost profitability since activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a$1.9 billion stakein the carrier last year. It has already announced that it’s ditching its open-seat policy in 2026 and retrofitting its planes with seats that have extra legroom for an additional charge.\nRelated articleAirlines brace for the summer of hell\nSouthwest said customers were clamoring for those changes. When people switch to a competitor from Southwest, the company said the top reason passengers cite is open seating. But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.\nThe airline has also changed the way it sells tickets. Traditionally it only sold them on Southwest’s website, but recently started sell them on Expedia to attract more customers.\nAlso beginning Wednesday, Southwest will start selling “basic economy” fares, which are low-priced tickets but with tons of restrictions. It’s a ticket type that’s replacing its famous “Wanna Get Away” fare and is becoming increasingly common among larger carriers to compete against low fares offered by budget airlines."

    "content": "In the year 2000, HBO advertised Ellen DeGeneres’ latest comedy special with a Botticelli reference. Perched inside a clam shell and surrounded by figures from the original painting, DeGeneres created her own “Birth of Venus” for the promotional print poster — subbing out nudity for a more signature white pantsuit. (Both HBO and CNN share the parent company Warner Bros. Discovery).\nThree years late for a magazine advertisement, the now-defunct Toyota sub-brand, Scion, decided to reproduce Damien Hirst’s controversial sculpture “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living” (1991) by suspending their XII model in a tank of seafoam green formaldehyde. In the same decade, there was a surprisingly artistic print artwork for thesixthseason of the popular 2005 CBS TV show “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”. In the ad, cast members gaze through the window of a neon-lit diner lifted straight out of American painter Edward Hopper’s seminal painting “Nighthawks” (1942).\nEach of the campaigns may appear to have little in common, but they reveal an unmistakable truth about the advertising industry: before digital marketing became the norm, overtaking print in terms of revenue and budget allocation, there was arguablymore room for complex, creative and daring image-making. Jim Heimann, graphic designer, historian and the editor of the forthcoming book “All-American Ads of the 2000s” — available in the UK from April 14 and in the US a month later — is worried these might be the last of their kind. “Print is slowly disappearing. That’s a problem,” he said.\n‘The material isn’t there anymore’\nLike a skilled archaeologist, Heimann has spent his life hunting down and preserving American cultural relics, such as cocktail napkins collected while researching the country’s penchant for drive-in restaurants to travel brochures from the early 20th century.\nA fixture at Sunday flea markets for the last 50 years, Heimann finds they are a good location to scour for magazines — often the first thing to go following a home clearout, he said. He normally turns to eBay to source specific ads, despite the added cost, and takes care to cherry pick from across pop culture, selecting the most artfully designed campaigns  for top movies, popular games and even beloved cereal brands, among others. With each decision, he’s thinking:  “What would I want to revisit 20 years from now?”\nIn 2000, Heimann was commissioned by Taschen to create a series of books that mapped the visual fluctuations of the advertising industry. He started with the 1950s, a post-war period often referred to as the golden age of capitalism in the US, sourcing John Wayne-fronted Camel ads, glossy Cadillac double-page spreads and kitschy lingerie illustrations. Then he went back to the ‘30s, the ‘40s and jumped forward to the ‘60s, following each decade until the last tome cataloging the Wild West of the ‘90s hit the shelves in 2022. This edition on the aughts, however, will likely conclude the collection. “We had a discussion about doing 2010 to 2020,” Heimann told CNN in a video call. “But the material just isn’t there anymore.”\nChronicling the earlier part of the decade has proved difficult. As the book’s foreword by Steven Heller, former senior art director of the New York Times, reads: “Advertising did not change when the Times Square ball fell at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, but the industry began its creative decline in the 2000s” — a period when digital advertising was starting to creep in. When Google launched its AdWords platform in 2000, small businesses could eschew forking out for expensive visual campaigns and instead promote themselves on Google’s search results page with text-based adverts. By 2001, television had surpassed newspapers in terms of ad revenue for the first time in the US.\nThese developments mark “the end of a century of advertising,” said Heimann.\nSocietal shifts\nFor Heimann, ads offer insight into the values and aspirations as well as political and economic environments of a generation. On compiling them in the book, he explained: “We always have a staple of 10 categories, but we expand them according to the decades. For instance, in the 1940s we had to expand war-related ads. They were really predominant, all these companies that were no longer producing automobiles or tires were doing everything for the war effort.”\nIn the aughts, many of the ads were focused on technology. “The tech world just blew up,” Heimann said. “Everything fell into that (category) consistently.” It was the 10-year-period that saw the invention of the first ever iPhone, the iMac, the iBook, the MacBook, the iPad, the iPod, iPod Nano and iPod Mini — and that’s just Apple. Heimann also found old Motorola, Blackberry, Sony and Nokia ads, along with a slew of brands that are no longer in existence.\nAmid a shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and sexual freedom, the concept of “sex sells” became a common marketing strategy in the ‘70s — so much so that it would be difficult to tell the difference between a Dolce & Gabbana campaign and an ad for Durex, said Heimann. Sexual marketing imagery continues to be prevalent, despite advertising’s changing tides (seeJeremy Allen White’s racy Calvin Klein underwear campaignin 2024, which Heimann sought to collect but failed to find a print copy, even after searching through 15 men’s magazines at his local newsstand).\nIn a Gucci ad from 2002, a topless male model is photographed side-on, undoing the monogrammed belt of his ‘G’ embroidered jeans — the leather strap in-hand creating a “sophomoric suggestion of an enhanced male appendage,” wrote Heller in the book. A Tom Ford menswear shoot Heimann preserved from 2008 shows an entirely naked female model grabbing the crotch of a suited man. “Females are always exploited,” he pointed out. “But to the extent of how they exploit women just becomes (implausible).”\nRelated articleWhy Calvin Klein ads still get people talking\nAt least the French brand Sisley somewhat evened the score, with an advert of a nude man saddled up and being ridden by a fully clothed woman. Still, to Heimann, this level of sexualization is “toned down” compared to the material he has collected from the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Now, we’ve got this new era of hyper masculinity,” Heimann said, referring to Trump’s hypermasculine campaign messaging that called for a return of gender roles, as well as the rise of “manosphere” influencers such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, who push male-supremacist viewpoints and call for the subservience of women on platforms such as YouTube. “Where’s that going to take us?” he questioned.\nThe future of ads\nBetween the leaps in AI technology and the new US administration, Heimann has questions not only on what adverts in the future might look like, but also who might be making them in the first place. It’s unlikely advertisers will want to spend on an agency to deliver a campaign when they can create them using AI for a fraction of the price. Arecent studyconducted by the University of Oxford suggests that AI-generated advertising images performed more effectively than human-made ones, as long as the images used do not look like artificial intelligence.\n“Where will that creative world go?” Heimann mused. “It’ll have to play out, but it doesn’t bode well.” A fixation on cutting costs might only become greater in light of President Donald Trump’s anti-European initiatives and the recently announced 25% tariffs on imported cars among other products. “How do you sell a car that’s 25% more (expensive) than another car?” Heimann asked. “Who’s going to buy a Subaru (or) a Volvo (if they) charge 25% more than an American car?”\nFor Heimann, advertisements of the last two decades have been selling a steady version of the American Dream. “In the ‘90s and the early 2000s, advertising still has that same cadence to it. The population looks the same, the automobiles look the same,” he said. Now, Heimann thinks that as America continues to evolve, more monumental changes will come in the years ahead. “I’ve been asked the question, ‘Did 9/11 affect advertising and how people perceived it?’ I think there was a little bump (in the road)… But I think what’s happening currently is going to be much more impactful,” he said.\n“All-American Ads of the 2000s”, published by Taschen, is available in the UK now, and in the US from May 14.\nCorrection:A previous version of this story misstated the production country of the car manufacturer Scion."

    "title": "How motherhood is being reframed in art",
    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/27/style/caroline-walker-motherhood-in-art",
    "content": "In Caroline Walker’s 2022 painting “Bottles and Pumps”, various breastfeeding paraphernalia lies drying on a white tray. “That’s been an interesting one, in terms of how people have responded,” she wrote to CNN over email, relaying the painting’s reception as part of “Acts of Creation: On Art and Motherhood”, a touring group show curated by art critic Hettie Judah. “It was the painting men responded to most when it was first shown (at Stephen Friedman Gallery in London), with (their) memories of bottle feeds or being tasked with cleaning and sterilizing the apparatus in those strange first months with a new baby,” said Walker.\nThe work was initially produced as part of “Lisa”, a series of paintings capturing Walker’s sister-in-law in the weeks immediately before, and three months after, giving birth.\nAt The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in the north of England, pieces from “Lisa” join other artworks by the Scottish artist in a major new solo show, titled “Mothering,” in an intimate survey of early motherhood and the extended support network that helps new mothers navigate the experience — from midwives and cleaners, to grandmothers and childcare workers. The show includes work made during Walker’s 2021 artist’s residency at a London hospital maternity ward (“Birth Reflections”) and depicting her young daughter’s nursery (“Nurture”).\n“’Mothering’ felt like an expansive title that could describe acts of care, which weren’t limited to the relationship between biological mother and child, reflecting the wide range of people who become part of our lives in the early years of childhood,” shared Walker, reflecting on the deliberate reframing of how motherhood is characterized and tethering it to the socio-economic structures of labor she has previously studied. “I liked that the term is a verb describing the act of providing care and nurture, rather than a specific identity or fixed relationship.”\nModern interpretations\nThe theme of motherhood has been a core focus for artists for centuries, though it is often with men in the role of the author, rendering scenes they only know secondhand. See Gustav Klimt’s “The Three Ages of Women”, or Caravaggio’s controversial “Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri)” — indeed, the many depictions of the Madonna and Child make it perhaps the most widely celebrated and frequently circulated image in the genre of mother and children in art.\nFor Walker however, it wasn’t always an obvious subject matter. “Motherhood wasn’t a preoccupation for me, so I wasn’t looking for it in the world around me,” she said. “I’ve always been drawn to images of women in painting. Some of course were depictions of motherhood, but it wasn’t something I was especially drawn to.”\n“My work is very routed in a Western painting tradition and frequently references, directly and indirectly, specific genres,” Walker continued, “but I try to approach these through a contemporary female lens, asking if the perspective of a woman artist can add something different.” In Walker’s own research, she found a sense of commonality in the work of Impressionist painters Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot; “The Wet Nurse Angele Feeding Julie Manet”, made by Morisot in 1880, in particular shares a dialogue with her own perspective.\nRelated cardWhat does the first year of motherhood look like? For this photographer — and many other women — it was dark and complex\n“The relationship of exchange that’s at play in the painting really interests me. Morisot is paying another woman to nurture her child, so she can work and make that exchange the subject of the work itself,” Walker explained, referencing the balancing act that has commonly been an obstacle for women who are parents, especially working-class individuals and those from marginalized communities, generally and also within creative industries, where income is typically less stable. “I’ve been thinking a lot about the relationship between paid and unpaid care and the transactional nature of nurseries and paid childcare, a service we rely on as a society and which I myself utilize.”\n“Mothering” then, in title and content, stretches the typical narrative and asks the viewer to revise how we might imagine motherhood to be presented creatively, building on the vast visual library constructed by women artists over the last century. Louise Bourgeois for example, whose “Maman” sculpture recently returned to London’s Tate Modern, frequently interrogated ideas about motherhood and maternity in her work, while Alice Neel often painted mothers and their children informed, in some part, by her own understanding of the relationship (in an early piece from 1930, she fused her own story with the Virgin Mary’s, producing “Degenerate Madonna”).\nIn photography too, these roles and the associated rituals have regularly been a vehicle for expression, from Carrie Mae Weems’s “Kitchen Table Series”, featuring a mother and daughter make-up session, to Rineke Dijkstra’s “New Mothers”, wherein the photographer documented women and their hours-old newborns. In 2020, the American photographer Maggie Shannon began accompanying midwives on home visits for what would become “Extreme Pain, Extreme Joy”, an echo of Walker’s hospital residency. And in 2023, Andi Galdi Vinko’s “Sorry I Gave Birth I Disappeared But Now I’m Back”, a confronting but ultimately warm account of the first years of motherhood, won the UK’s Kraszna-Krausz Foundation Photography Book Award.\nNew traction\nWhile hardly a new arena, in 2025 it seems there is a considerable effort, as part of a wider campaign of awareness and correction, to foreground these artists, just as women artists more broadly have begun to receive their flowers. The volume of interest in Walker’s work is a prime example of this. In addition to “Mothering”, her paintings are currently on display in three group shows: the Scottish leg of “Acts of Creation” at Dundee Contemporary Arts, “Good Mom/Bad Mom” at Centraal Museum in Utrecht, and at Dussedorf’s Kunstpalast in “MAMA: From Mary to Merkel”.\nI liked that the term is a verb describing the act of providing care and nurture, rather than a specific identity or fixed relationship.\nArtist Caroline Walker\nIn “Mothering: The Family Reborn”, the closing chapter of a Thames & Hudson publication that accompanies Judah’s “Acts of Creation” exhibition, the critic celebrates the notion of mothering as perceived by queer artists, oftentimes in a political context, exploring how “committing to networks of care” and a broader sense of shared responsibility has previously been, and has the potential to, further comprise modern iterations of motherhood. Here, she references artists such as Sadie Lune, Zanele Muholi and Cathy Cade.\nIn Walker’s case, the term mothering arrived via a member of the team at her daughter’s nursery, who explained that it was a key part of their training. Subsequently, Walker said she began reflecting on “the constellation of women that are part of my children’s care and education, performing vital work and informing a period of a child’s life, which research has shown is important to their development throughout childhood and beyond.”\n“I had been exploring the subject of women’s working lives for a few years but becoming a mother really opened my eyes to this whole area of women’s labor in relation to the bearing and rearing of children,” Walker continued. “Women artists have been responding to the demands of motherhood for decades but haven’t always enjoyed the same exposure or validation. If I was making this work 10 years ago, I don’t think it would be getting so much traction.”"

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/26/style/rebecca-black-amas-2025-lotw",
    "content": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly,‘Look of the Week’is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.\nThe American Music Awards returned after a two-year hiatus to a new location in Las Vegas, and while several celebrities seemed to take style inspiration from Sin City, none took the brief more seriously (or unseriously) than Rebecca Black, who stepped onto the red carpet dressed for a shotgun wedding.\nBlack’s ivory silk taffeta dress was flouncy and corseted, and she paired it with a bridal veil and monogrammed sailor hat — the latter accessory a signature of the LA designer Erik Charlotte’s maritime-influenced fall 2024 capsule collection.\nWhen asked by Variety if she said she wanted a wedding gown, Black joked: “I did not, but then we ended up here, and I said of course I’m getting married.” At another point, she told Billboard she wanted to look like “an angel,” adding, “I wanted to float down the carpet.”\nBlack, who rose to fame in 2011 as a teen for her viral pop song “Friday,” has pivoted in adulthood to hyperpop and Boiler Room-approved DJ sets, opening for Katy Perry and striking out on her own tours, too. She’s been candid about how her early fame negatively impacted her mental health, telling Good Morning America in 2020 she became “unbelievably depressed” due to online bullying over her song.\nOver the past few years, as she’sembracedan openly queer identity, her return to music has been more tongue-in-cheek with campy, party-girl aesthetics that have gained her a new cult following. At the AMAs, she told Billboard she’s “taking it one day at a time. I have a lot of fun with what I do obviously,” she added, gesturing to her look.\nBlack’s ensemble stood out during an unusually subdued red carpet, with many celebrities skipping the step-and-repeat — or the event altogether. The night paid tribute to icons including Janet Jackson and Gloria Estefan, but a number of nominated and winning artists sent recorded messages in lieu of attending.\nRelated articleLook of the Week: Alexander Skarsgård flips the script on thigh-high leather boots\nOut of those who did arrive, some, like Black, leaned into the Vegas look, though overall the night’s fashion was disjointed. As the event’s host, Jennifer Lopez had multiple glittering and voluminous outfit changes fit for location, while Benson Boone performed in a bold purple floral suit by Dolce & Gabbanaand Shaboozey donned bedazzled plaid chaps by Etro. Ciara arrived in a showgirl-esque Bronx and Banco bodysuit dripping in chains — acknowledging to Billboard that “we gotta bring bling bling to Vegas” in a red-carpet interview, while Heidi Montag glittered in a blue flared jumpsuit by The Blonds.\nThough Black might not be rushing off to Vegas’s wedding chapels, bridal looks have a long history of closing out runways. And as the event’s official closer — the AMAs’ afterparty DJ — her irreverent look fit the bill."

    "content": "The Cannes Film Festival, now in its 78th year, has officially drawn to a close. The event — which since 13 May has seen actors, directors, producers and influencers make their way up the carpeted steps — is a jewel in the calendar of both lofty cinephiles and polished fashionistas. Stars arrive not just to promote their latest feature film at the high temple of world cinema, but also to turn a look.\nThis year, the fashion stakes were upped before the festival even opened its doors — prompted bya change in the official dress code, announced just hours before kick-off. Nudity was explicitly banned (prohibiting the current celebrity favorite “naked” dress trend that has dominated the red carpet in recent years); as were “voluminous outfits” with large trains for the sake of traffic control.\nSome stars, like Halle Berry, dutifully obeyed the restrictions. “I had an amazing dress by (Gaurav) Gupta that I cannot wear tonight because it’s too big of a train,” the actorsaid at a news conference. “I’m not going to break the rules.” Others brazenly persevered with their original wardrobe plans. Heidi Klum and Wan QianHui were the first rebels of the year, arriving in high-octane frocks with defiantly cascading trains.\nRelated articleCannes Film Festival bans nudity on the red carpet.

    "title": "Flat shoes are now allowed at the Cannes Film Festival. Can they rise to the occasion?",
    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/24/style/cannes-flat-shoes-red-carpet",
    "content": "‘Naked dresses’ may be out, but flat shoes — according to the official Cannes Film Festival dress code — are in. It’s a sartorial judgement that may feel well overdue, after a group of women made headlines in 2015 for being reportedly refused entry to a screening for their ground-height footwear.\nWhile the festival has never officially stated such a rule, according to event organizer Thierry Fremaux, who in 2015 asserted on X that    a heels-only mandate did not exist, the perceived preference for high heels led to a backlash known as #flatgate, criticizing the perceived pressure on women. It set in motion a series of mini red-carpet protests and conversations around the inherent misogyny embedded in gendered dress codes.\nIn 2016, Julia Roberts walked the Cannes red carpet barefoot in the ultimate act of defiance. Two years later, Kirsten Stewart tiptoed around the rule by arriving in stilettos and pointedly removing them when arriving at the photographer’s pit. In 2023, Jennifer Lawrence inadvertently reignited the conversation when she lifted up her Dior haute couture ball gown to descend the Croisette, revealing a surprisingly pedestrian-looking pair of black flip flops (she maintains the decision wasn’t deliberately disobedient, and that the shoes she had originally intended to wear were one size too big).\nFor the last few years, however, the festival has expressed written permission for guests to wear shoesand sandals “with or without a heel” — stipulating only that they were “elegant.” Slowly but surely, more celebrities are taking the bait. In 2024, Jane Fonda attended the festival wearing a pair of silver Margaux Mary Janes while Margaret Qualley opted for a pair of Chanel sequined ballet flats. This year, film directors Alice Rohrwacher and Molly Manning Walker wore Prada loafers onto the Croisette, while actor Llúcia Garcia arrived in black leather lace-up ballet flats.\nThe flat shoe revival\nFor the most part, flat shoes have long been considered the domain of the elderly, the clumsy or the unfashionable. In Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” Margot Robbie must choose (red pill, blue pill style) between a stiletto and a Birkenstock. When her arches collapse and her heels touch the floor, Barbie is treated with as much trepidation as a contagious biohazard by the other dolls. “Flat feet!” gasps Hari Nef in her role as Doctor Barbie.\nAfter Carrie Bradshaw’s hip surgery in season two of “Sex and the City” reboot “And Just Like That…” her main concern was being unable to slip into a teetering pair of Manolo Blahniks — revealing that she hadn’t bought a pair of flats in over a decade. (The television series and sequel aired on HBO and Max, respectively, which share the same parent company as CNN: Warner Bros. Discovery.)\nPreviously, any sightings of low-profile footwear at Cannes have been few and far between: Uma Thurman in 2011, Karlie Kloss in 2014, Susan Sarandon in 2016. “It’s a misconception that to look dressy one needs huge heels,” French fashion designer and model Inès de la Fressange — who has regularly flouted Cannes’ unofficial flat ban — told Vogue in 2015. “Were Greek ancient statues wearing heels with their togas? Did Cleopatra wear platforms?”\nNow, a decade on from #flatgate, the much-maligned footwear is finally welcomed onto one of the most historic and glamorous red carpets in the world. But can they rise to the occasion?\nRelated articleLook of the Week: Alexander Skarsgård flips the script on thigh-high leather boots\nThere is indication that they already have. According to Pinterest Trends, searches for “ballet flats” in the US were up around 190% this month compared to data collected in May 2023.(Growth in searches for high heels across the same time period was 53%.) Meanwhile, almost twice as many people worldwide were searching for “Mary Janes”this yearthan in 2023, according to Google Trends data.\nAt New York Fashion Week in September 2024, fashion label Tory Burch resurrected the Reva — a round-toe ballet flat that comes in soft or patent leather, stamped with the label’s circular medallion — that had been out of production since 2017. The glitzy pump was launched in 2006 and sold five million pairs in just seven years, before appetite for slim, dainty shoes dropped off in the mid-to-late 2010s. The death knell was the advent of the “Dadcore” chunky trainers movement (think Balenciaga Triple S sneakers or the Fila Disruptors — both of which were released the same year the Reva was put to rest).\nNow, it appears, ballet flats rule the roost once more. Sandy Liang’s rehearsal-ready satin Pointe toe shoe ($550) was the cult item that put the designer on the map, with the first batch launched in 2022 selling out in just two days. Alaïa’s crystal Mary Jane flats — a rhinestone studded black leather pump with a matching over-the-foot strap that retails for $1,350 — was first introduced in 2022, yet the embellished style still came fourth in Lyst’s ranking of the hottest fashion products last year.\nPerhaps coincidentally, Miu Miu (one of the few luxury brands defying a global downturn) boasts a remarkably varied and long-standing flat-shoe offering — with 14 styles on their site currently priced from $875 to $1,790. “I think people want alternatives, and shoes they can walk in,” observed Mosha Lundström Halbert, a fashion journalist and social media commentator under the handle @newsfash.\nFor Lundström Halbert, the comeback of the flat shoe is partly down to a new generation of shoppers coming of age in a more flexible corporate environment. “When I first started out as a fashion editor in 2008, you wore heels to work,” she said over the phone. “Even when I was an intern, I was in a Givenchy by Ricardo Tisci stiletto, because that’s what (actor turned designer) Ashley Olsen wore.”\nOffice dress codes have also evolved as a result of hybrid working styles. “It’s more socially acceptable to wear something that previously would have been viewed as quite casual,” Lundström Halbert said. “It’s probably easier for a lot of consumers to justify spending on a flat that they know they’re going to wear all summer long, than it is a pair of stilettos that are really only for select occasions,” she added.\nRelated videoWhy guests keep breaking the rules on this red carpet\nAs high heels become less of a requisite in certain arenas, the Cannes red carpet — whose ostentation is rivaled only by the Met Gala or the Oscars — is something of a final frontier.\n“I think we’re re-examining a lot of tropes right now in society when it comes to how women are meant to present,” said Lundström Halbert. “We’re moving towards integrating the way people dress in real life on the red carpet for (those outfits) to resonate and stand out.” Plus, as Lundström Halbert noted, “there’s something (about a flat shoe) that breaks free from the pageantry of it all. It’s refreshing.”"

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/21/weather/may-noreaster-memorial-day-weekend-climate",
    "content": "Memorial Day weekend marks the unofficial start of summer for many in the United States, but it won’t feel like that in the East leading up to the holiday thanks in part to a rare Maynor’easter.\nA one-two-punch of storms is delivering soaking rain and gusty winds to the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic that will continue into some of the holiday weekend. The miserable weather will be made even more miserable by unusually chilly temperatures that feel more like early March.\nNor’easters – coastal storms that track along the East Coast – are more common from September through April, rather than the warmer months in the US, according tothe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThey’re usually fueled by a strong jet stream that sets up between a clash of colder air sweeping south over the East and warmer air pushing north over the Atlantic Ocean.\nThat scenario rarely comes together from late spring to early fall because temperatures in the East are typicallymore on par with the heat over the Atlantic during that time. Without a temperature clash, the jet stream is weaker and there will be no nor’easters.\nThat’s not the case this week. The weather pattern underway in the East looks more like it would when winter turns to spring, despite summer being right around the corner.\nRight now, parts of the Arctic are unusually hot. It’s been arecord-hot May in Iceland, while parts of Greenland and Arctic Canada have also been feeling unseasonable heat.\nAll that heat has ejected colder air from the Arctic and sent it farther south than normal for nearly-June, setting up the temperature clash to fuel this rare nor’easter.\nA warming Arctic has already been linked to changes in nor’easters. As parts of the region heat up faster than the rest of the globe due to fossil fuel pollution, studies have shown thatit may be causing winter nor’easters to get worse.\nWhat to expect Memorial Day weekend\nA first storm brought cool, wet weather to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Wednesday and its effects were lingering Thursday as it drifted over the Great Lakes. The nor’easter developed east of the first storm Wednesday night and was located just off the mid-Atlantic coast on Thursday afternoon.\nNor’easters are typically powerhouse storms that can deal major impacts, but this week’s  is packing a relatively mild punch.\nThe nor’easter will strengthen some as it slowly pushes toward New England, bringing more rain and gusty winds to the Northeast and churning up rough seas for much of the coast into the weekend.\nSteady rain fell over the Northeast from Wednesday into Thursday morning, and will continue on and off for the next few days.\nMost of the region will record up to 2 inches of rain from Wednesday through Saturday with closer to 3 inches possible in some spots in southern New England, parts of New Jersey and New York. The Northeast has been quite wet in recent weeks, so the rain could lead to some localized flooding or rises on waterways, but widespread flash flooding is unlikely.\nNor’easters are synonymous with snow, but despite temperatures dropping as low as the 40s in parts of northern New England, any chances for it are quite low and confined to the highest mountain peaks.\nIt will be breezy in parts of the Northeast from Thursday through Saturday, especially in southern New England. The combination of saturated soils, rain and gusty winds could bring down some trees and power lines. The damp, windy weather could also hinder travel on the road or at the region’s busy airports.\nSome dampness will linger into Sunday but then temperatures will start to rebound. Seasonable temperatures and some sunshine will return just in time for Memorial Day on Monday in much of the Northeast.\nCNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam contributed to this report."

    "content": "Staring down another above-average hurricane season, America’s weather forecasting and disaster response agencies are more hollowed out than ever before – and that could leave tens of millions of Americans more vulnerable to these massive storms.\nBoth the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are entering the season in turmoil, having lost thousands of experts and staff since President Donald Trump took office in January, intent on culling the federal workforce.\nMany of those lost have been specialists in weather forecasting, storm response and resilience, among other skills involved in hurricane preparation, prediction and recovery.\nThe cuts come as human-caused climate change is super-charging storms – causing Atlantic hurricanes to produce heavier rainfall and intensify more rapidly than in previous decades. Destructive Hurricanes Milton and Helene underwent rapid intensification last season before making landfall, for example.\nAnother above-average hurricane season is in store this year, NOAA announced Thursday morning: 13 to 19 named storms, 6 to 10 of which will become hurricanes, and 3 to 5 of these may grow to major hurricane intensity of Category 3 or stronger. NOAA said they have 70% confidence in this particular outlook.\nAnaverage Atlantic hurricane seasonwould be 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes and 3 become major hurricanes.\nAt FEMA, which leads the nation’s disaster response and recovery, current and former officials say repeated calls from Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “eliminate” the agency have led to internal confusion on what its mission is, and how quickly it should respond to disaster requests from states.\nFEMA took two months to approve disaster aid for deadly mid-March tornados that ripped through red states, leading to an outcry from some Republican lawmakers.\n“When it’s taking months for a disaster declaration to be granted, the people on the ground could potentially think, well, FEMA is just not going to be here because they’re gone, because the president and the (DHS) secretary got rid of them,” said Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA chief under Biden.\n“There’s always been confusion about what FEMA’s role is the response phase of a disaster,” Criswell added. “I think given this conversation, it just creates even greater misunderstanding of, ‘Do they even exist?’”\nBurnout = bad forecasts\nThe Trump administration’s steps to reduce the size of the federal government, which included firings, early retirement incentives and other programs, resulted in more than 560 National Weather Service employees leaving the agency since January. The fear of burnout is high among the remaining forecasters at the agency’s 122 local offices.\n“I am worried about staffing at the local offices for hurricane events,” one NOAA employee told CNN, noting thethin staffing at some Gulf coastal offices. They requested anonymity for fear of retribution. “Maybe the first event will be fine, but fatigue will be quite real by peak season. People will do whatever they can to get the job done, but they can’t work around the clock, seven days a week.”\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami is fully staffed for the season, but the local offices are responsible for tailoring forecast information and warnings for their areas, and many of them are missing multiple forecasters, technicians and hydrologists.\nSome are also missing their chief meteorologists, depriving the staff of the most experienced forecaster and manager on their team.\nThe risk of burnout increases if multiple hurricanes track over the same parts of the country — something that happened last year.\nThe NOAA staff member also said the staffing concerns go hand in hand with the prospect that less data may be available for making accurate hurricane forecasts, given recent reductions in daily weather balloon launches around the country.\nSuch balloons provide crucial data for computer models used to help meteorologists predict the weather, and it’s unlikely low staffing would allow such launches to ramp up to four times a day, which is more typical when a hurricane threatens to make landfall in the US.\n“There almost certainly will be less data for the models,” they said. This could threaten the accuracy of hurricane intensity and track forecasts, areas that meteorologists have made gains in during the past decade.\nNobody ‘to make the strategic decisions’\nTrumpfirst suggestedhe might eliminate FEMA in the days after taking office, while touring Hurricane Helene damage in North Carolina. Since then, the agency has been embroiled in chaos and staffing cuts. About 10% of FEMA’s total workforce has left since January, and projections indicate staff loss will increase to 30% by the end of this calendar year.\nDepartures have included senior officials experienced in managing the federal response to major storms. The acting FEMA administrator was recently fired after he told lawmakers he does not support dismantling the agency, breaking with Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem and other high-ranking DHS officials.\nOne disaster expert said removing high-level FEMA leaders while shifting more responsibilities to states is “a recipe for disaster.”\n“You don’t have anyone there to make the strategic decisions that need to be made in these unprecedented events,” said Wendy Huff Ellard, who leads the disaster recovery team at law firm Baker Donelson. “These things aren’t cookie cutter; there’s really no guidebook.”\nA recentinternal FEMA reviewunderscored the agency’s lack of preparedness for this year’s hurricane season, CNN reported. The review stated the agency “is not ready” for the June 1 start to hurricane season, noting a general uncertainty around its mission, lack of coordination with states and other federal agencies, low morale and new red tape that will likely slow responses.\n“The lack of clarity is not helping anyone prepare,” Huff Ellard said. “I think people are so confused at this point about the process and what’s going to be there and what they should be doing, that it is taking resources away from the preparedness effort.”\nAt a hearing on Capitol Hill last week, Noem told lawmakers, “there is no formalized, final plan” for restructuring the agency and shifting responsibilities to states.\nMore recently, FEMAhas re-opened training centersto prepare staff for hurricane season and lengthened contract extensions for part-time workers that deploy to areas during disasters. But one FEMA official told CNN they are concerned the preparations are happening too late.\nCriswell, the former FEMA head, told CNN one of the agency’s most important functions is coordinating the many other federal agencies that pitch in during disasters, making sure it’s not needlessly duplicating rescue and recovery efforts.\nFEMA takes its lead from each state’s emergency management director, Criswell said.\n“That’s why FEMA has somebody that is coordinating the federal resources, so you don’t have people just going out there on their own,” she added. “(The Department of Defense) could be doing something that the Coast Guard is doing. Or you’re going to miss critical functions that need to happen.”\nEven if states step up, it would be difficult for them to totally replicate the footprint of a federal response.\nEven before FEMA and NOAA lost staff, there were not enough resources for storm response and recovery, said Carrie Speranza, president of the International Association of Emergency Managers-USA. But if states must play a larger role, governors may have less incentive to send their mutual aid resources to neighboring hard-hit states.\nSperanza said people should not assume this season that first responders and community resilience staff will come to their rescue if they are hit with a major storm.\n“It’s all for one, and not one for all. That’s a very different environment especially when you are talking about helping people on their worst day,” she said. “We haven’t had time to adjust. The ‘abolish FEMA’ thing took us all by surprise.”"

    "content": "Multiple tornadoes and intense storms hit the eastern half of the United States on Tuesday as a relentlesssevere weatherpattern that left 28 people dead in recent days began to wind down.\nDamaging storms tore through parts of 10 states – including areas already battered by this spring’s storms likeKentuckyand Tennessee – on Tuesday, unleashing multiple tornadoes, damaging wind gusts and hail bigger than baseballs.\nThere have been more than 2,000 reports to the Storm Prediction Center of damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes since last Wednesday and more than two dozen states have reported some sort of storm damage in that span. The stretch of violent weather killed 19 people in Kentucky, seven in Missouri, and two in Virginia.\nIt also prompted four tornado emergencies– the most serious tornado warning issued by the National Weather Service – in Illinois, Alabama and Kansas since Friday. At least two EF4-strength tornadoes and multiple EF3s have been confirmed so far.\nThe weather pattern behind these seven consecutive days of dangerous thunderstorms is easing up significantly Wednesday, though a few pockets of severe storms are still possible.\nDestructive storms hit multiple states Tuesday\nTornado watches stretched across parts of 11 states Tuesday afternoon as storms roared to life.\nA possible tornado damaged a Kirkland’s warehouse close to Jackson Regional Airport in Madison County, Tennessee, causing substantial damage to the roof, according to the county’s emergency management agency.\nA “large and destructive tornado” was confirmed in Madison County, Alabama, near Huntsville in the evening, the National Weather Service said, prompting a rare tornado emergency for part of the county.\nHuntsville also received reports of “golf ball size hail and related damage along with a lot of power outages,” said city spokesperson Kelly Schrimsher. Authorities so far have not reported any injuries.\nIn a video obtained by CNN, a resident in the city of Madison, Alabama, west of Huntsville, captured a massive funnel cloud moving in the background of a road.\nAnother video from Madison shows a suburban neighborhood with a path of destruction “at least 1 mile long,”according to the residentwho posted it. At least one home is missing a roof, with debris and trees scattered on the road, the video showed.\nParts of northern Alabama and Georgia were battered by damaging wind gusts and heavy rain throughout the day and overnight Tuesday, with emergency authorities in both states reporting power outages and downed trees.\nPower was out for tens of thousands of homes and business across Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky early Wednesday morning, according to energy trackerPowerOutage.us.\nA few small pockets of severe weather are possible on Wednesday, but the threat is nowhere near as expansive as what’s played out over the past week.\nSeven straight days of damaging storms\nFerocious storms have carved through hundreds of miles of the US in recent days, and there have been more than 150 tornado reports since Wednesday.\nNational Weather Service storm survey teams are still picking through extensive damage to determine exactly how many tornadoes tore through the central and eastern US since last week, but they’ve confirmed multiple EF3s and two EF4s.\nAn EF4 tornado tore through Williamson County in southern Illinois on Friday with 190 mph winds, injuring at least seven people as it damaged homes and obliterated trees.\nAn EF3 tornado rocked the St. Louis area Friday, according to the NWS, reaching its peak intensity with 152 mph winds as it stretched a mile wide over the north side of the city. The tornado killed at least five people and injured dozens, while also “damaging or destroying thousands of buildings.”\nTracking destructive and deadly tornadoes in the US, in maps and charts\nStorms also left vast destruction behind in Laurel County, Kentucky, with 17 deaths reported there over the weekend. The city of London, about 75 miles south of Lexington, was hit particularly hard by an EF4 tornado with 170 mph winds. Police responding to mutual aid calls for tornado victimsdescribedthe devastation as overwhelming.\nThe twister’s track through Pulaski and Laurel was about 55 miles long and its maximum width was about a mile long, the county said. It was the deadliest tornado in the county’s history – the last tornado, and death from a twister, confirmed in the county was in 2012.\nEvacuations were briefly scheduled in London and other devastated parts of Laurel County Tuesday evening over fears that new storms could turn lingering debris into dangerous projectiles.\nSunday night saw tornadoes tear through Kansas, with authorities reporting significant damage to homes in the city of Plevna, roughly 60 miles from Wichita, and the small northwestern town of Grinnell.\nPlevna was under a rare tornado emergency, the most extreme tornado warning, issued by the National Weather Service.\nGrinnell endured a “large and extremely dangerous tornado” Sunday evening, according to the NWS. Crews later determined it was an EF3 with 140 mph winds.\nAbout 20 homes were destroyed in Grinnell, which is home to fewer than 300 people, according to Gove County Sheriff Shawn Mesch.\n“Essentially the entire west of Grinnell was destroyed,” Mesch told CNN Monday. But despite the level of destruction, there have been no reports of injuries: “It’s insane that nobody was hurt,” he said.\nThe threats didn’t let up Monday, with dangerous storms stretching more than 500 miles from northern Texas to Nebraska in the afternoon hours. Multiple dangerous tornadoes unfolded in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Nebraska.\nAt least five counties in Oklahoma were damaged by storms, according to the state’s emergency management.  Pittsburg County, in eastern Oklahoma, was hit hard by a tornado in the evening.\nCNN’s Karina Tsui, Matt Rehbein, Taylor Ward, Diego Mendoza Diaz, Ray Sanchez, Andy Rose, Joe Sutton and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report."

    "content": "A violent, tornado-spawning storm system tore across the central US, leaving at least 25 people dead in Missouri and southeastern Kentucky as it cut a path of destruction through several states.\nThe storm made its way towards Kansas and Oklahoma late Sunday, where significant damage was reported in Grinnell, a town some 250 miles west of Wichita. Photos show severely damaged homes, blocked roads and overturned vehicles. One image shows a local church with its roof blown off.\nParts of the I-70 and Kansas Highway northwest of the state have been closed due to downed power lines near Grinnell, according to roadway trackerKanDrive.\nIn the small town of Plevna, roughly 60 miles from Wichita, Reno County Sheriff Darrian Campbell said a passing tornado Sunday night caused significant damage to homes.\n“We did have a tornado touch down and travel approximately 12 miles and went through a small town of Plevna,” Campbell said in an email to CNN.\nThere are no reports of injuries in Kansas, where a life-threatening tornado alert was issued for the cities ofSylvia, Plevna, and Abbyvilleuntil roughly midnight CST. CNN has reached out to state authorities for more details.\nOver the weekend, 18 deaths were reported in Kentucky, just hours after authorities announced sevenfatalitiesin the St. Louis, Missouri area.\nTwo additional deaths were reported in northern Virginia. Both fatalities were caused by trees falling onto vehicles, one in Fairfax County and another on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, Fairfax County police and the United States Park Police said.\nThe storms damaged homes and downed power lines across the Midwest and Great Lakes, brought by the same system that produceddestructive storms and tornadoes Thursday.\nOver 100,000 homes and businesses across five states were without power as of Sunday night, with Missouri, Michigan and Arkansas among the hardest hit, according toPoweroutage.us.\nThe same storm system hit Colorado Sunday afternoon, producing at least two tornadoes. Homes and buildings in Arapahoe, Adams and Elbert County were damaged or lost, according the counties’ sheriff’s offices. No injuries were reported.\nIt’s part of a multiday spate of widespread severe weather stretching into early next week. As the system that generated deadly tornadoes in Missouri and Kentucky loses strength, another round of severe storms is expected near the border with Mexico, thrusting more than 20 million Americans across the Southwest in the risk zone.\nSoutheastern Kentucky hit hard\nThe National Weather Service reported a radar-confirmed, “large, extremely dangerous” tornado sweeping east across lower Kentucky shortly after midnight.\nVideo and photos from southeastern Kentucky show a trail of destruction that began in Pulaski County before moving east into neighboring Laurel County, leaving at least 18 dead and 10 in critical condition across the state. Videosshowedwidespread damage to buildings, cars, trees and infrastructure in the wake of the possible tornado.\n“I’ve now been governor for at least 14 federally declared disasters, 13 of them weather. And this is one of the worst,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference Saturday evening. “It’s one of the worst in terms of the loss of human life. It’s one of the worst in terms of damage.”\nBeshear has declared a state of emergency in the state and requested a federal disaster declaration.\nMahala Watts told CNNaffiliate WLKYher family was watching the news after 11 p.m. Friday when their phones started blaring with tornado warnings. She grabbed the dog, and her family took cover in the bathroom in the center of theirhome in Laurel County.\nThe storm suddenly roared over her house – as the family was “breathing in all the debris.” They got on their hands and knees, Watts told the station. A bathroom mirror fell on Watts before the roar went silent.\n“We were just kind of praying, you know, scared it was going to come back,” she said. “We had no idea the roof was gone. The fridge was blocking the bathroom door.”\nWatts told WLKY her family climbed over the refrigerator and stood outside in the dark, fearing another hit. Cars were overturned and debris wasstrewn about. They used a relative’s car to get to a hospital where they sought refuge before making it to a hotel after the storm passed.\nDrone video over London, Kentucky, at daylight Saturday showed a vast wasteland of damaged and overturned vehicles and flattened homes as first responders searched heaps of rubble for possible survivors. London is about 75 miles south of Lexington.\nAt the London-Corbin Airport, several planes were damaged and a medical helicopter was destroyed,CNN affiliate WLKYreported, adding officials said at least one airplane was pulled into a funnel cloud. Hangars and other buildings were leveled.\nIn another video from Laurel County, first responders are seen descending on the Sunshine Hills area, a barren landscape of twisted cars, downed trees and piles of debris.\nSeventeen deaths were reported in Laurel County, including in London, Mayor Randall Weddle toldCNN affiliate WKYT.Among those who died was Maj. Leslie Roger Leatherman of theLaurel County Fire Department, who had been responding to the storm, the governor said Saturday.\n“I have never personally witnessed what I’ve witnessed here tonight. There’s a lot of devastation,” Weddle told WKYT.\nPolice in Corbin, south of London, were responding to mutual aid calls for tornado victims anddescribedthe devastation as overwhelming.\n“Stop and pray for Laurel County residents and victims of the tornado that touched down there,” the department wrote.\nPulaski County Judge Executive Marshall Todd declared a state of emergency, and crews are working on cleanup efforts, county spokesperson John Alexander told CNN. One person was reported dead in the county.\nHeavy damage can be seen in Somerset, a city in Pulaski County to the west of London, where emergency officials urged residents to stay indoors.\n“The southern side of the city has been hit by a possible tornado!” the Somerset Fire Departmentposted on social mediaaround 11 p.m. Friday. “Please avoid the area, poles and power lines are down!”\nSt. Louis has massive damage\nA storm that produced a devastating tornado in the St. Louis area Friday afternoon has left five people dead and many others injured, according to local authorities. The EF3 tornado traveled at least 8 miles, according to aninitial surveyconducted by the National Weather Service.\n“We’re just a city that’s really grieving,” the city’s new mayor, Cara Spencer, told reporters Saturday. About 5,000 buildings have been impacted by the severe weather but she noted, “This community is coming together in a truly, truly amazing way.”\nSpencer called the event “one of the worst storms” in the city’s history. A curfew will remain in place overnight and thousands of homes and businesses still have no power. Nearly 40 people were injured, the mayor said. A state of emergency was declared in the city, and officials are seeking a federal major disaster declaration.\nMore than 130 miles to the south of St. Louis, in Scott County,two others were killedduring Friday’s storms, Sheriff Derick Wheetley announced on social media. Several others were taken to medical facilities, “with injuries ranging from minor to severe,” the sheriff added.\n“The tornado moved from the eastern part of the county, leaving behind a trail of destruction, with multiple homes completely lost and areas left unrecognizable,” the sheriff said.\nThe devastation occurred after a tornado warning was issued at 2:34 p.m. Friday and a “likely tornado” touched down seven to eight minutes later, said Ben Herzog, a science and operations officer with the National Weather Service.\nOne St. Louis resident,Cindy Spellman, told CNN her niece was in her apartment when the storm hit.\n“When the sirens sounded, she went to the basement of her building,” Spellman said.\nWhen her niece returned to her apartment, “she had to push her way inside because the tornado had thrown all of her furniture to the far walls.”\nThey helped clean up after the storm passed and had to park over a mile away due to road closures, Spellman said. Dirt, glass and debris from trees and nearby homes coated everything inside the apartment and building. It took more than four hours to secure her niece’s apartment, clean it and remove her necessary belongings before dark.\nAnotherresident, Joan Miller Hitt, was in her home Friday when it was torn apart like a dollhouse.\nWhen a large tree outside started swaying violently and all the doors shut like in the movie “Carrie,” Miller Hitt and her husband took shelter in a bathroom. Seconds later, “the whole back of the house was gone.”\nMiller Hitt said she never saw it coming.\n“I never had any fear of anything happening to that house with a storm because of where I live and the sound structure of the house,” she told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday afternoon. “I go between being overwhelmed, shocked, teary.”\nGov. Mike Kehoe said he has a﻿lready been in contact with federal officials about disaster relief. The American Red Cross opened three shelters in St. Louis for storm and tornado victims, the nonprofitannouncedSaturday.\nFirst responders looking for victims or people in distress searched about 4,000 residences. More technical searches with boom microphones and cameras were being conducted Saturday.\nOne victim was identified as Patricia Pendleton, who had been serving lunches before the storm caused a roof to collapse at Centennial Christian Church, her family toldCNN affiliate KMOV.\nSarah Russell, commissioner of the City Emergency Management Agency in St. Louis, said some of the tornado sirens did not go off Friday, which will be investigated.\n“We’re looking into that,” she told reporters Saturday. The focus now is on life-saving measures in the community, she added.\nThe citywide system of tornado sirens was being replaced and had undergone testing on Thursday. Residents were encouraged to rely on multiple warning systems, including mobile apps and weather radio, she said.\nThe National Weather Serviceis surveying the damage and has no information on the intensity but estimated winds reached 100 mph.\nHerzog’s message for residents: “I think the biggest thing would be staying away if you don’t need to be around.”\nDamaging storm risks persist\nAs the system that hit Missouri and Kentucky weakens and pushes across the Southeast, another round of severe storms threatens the Great Plains and Texas.\nThe level 3 of 5 threat ofsevere storms will affect the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex Saturday evening, with large hail, damaging winds and the potential for tornadoes.\nThe possibility of more severe weather stretches through Tuesday in the Great Plains and the lower Mississippi River Valley.\nThe Plains will remain the main focus of severe weather on Sunday and Monday as well as the storms passing through Oklahoma and Kansas. The severe thunderstorm threat will then shift back into parts of the Mississippi Valley on Tuesday.\nCNN’s Kelly Murray, Scott Withers, Phil Gast and Isaac Yee contributed to this report."

    "content": "Hong Kong’sfirst locally born giant pandashave finally been named and introduced as Jia Jia and De De.\nThe names of the cubs, affectionately known as “Elder Sister” and “Little Brother,” were announced Tuesday in a ceremony at Ocean Park, the theme park housing them, their parents and two other giant pandas that arrived from mainland China last year.\nThe names were the winning suggestions from residents in a naming contest that drew more than 35,700 entries.\nThe Chinese character “Jia,” from the female cub’s name “Jia Jia,” carries a message of support and features an element of family and a sense of auspicious grace. The name embodies the prosperity of families and the nation and the happiness of the people, the park said.\nThe Chinese character “De,” from the male cub’s name, means to succeed, carrying the connotation that Hong Kong is successful in everything. De also has the same pronunciation as the Chinese character for virtue, the park said, suggesting giant pandas possess virtues cherished by Chinese people.\nOcean Park chairman Paulo Pong said they followed tradition by using Mandarin pronunciation for the pandas’ English names. He said “Jia” sounds like a word in the Cantonese term for elder sister, while “De De” sounds a bit like the Cantonese phrase for little brother. Cantonese is the mother language of many Hong Kongers.\n“It’s a very positive pair of names,” he said. “We have to be a bit creative here with the names.”\nRelated articleChina is more in love with its pandas than ever. That’s complicated matters for Beijing\nThe twins’ birth in August made their mother, Ying Ying, the world’s oldest first-time panda mom. Their popularity among residents, visitors and on social media raised hopes for a tourism boost in the city, where politicians touted the commercial opportunities as the “panda economy.”\nObservers are watching whether housing six pandas helps the park revive its business, especially when caring for the animals in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year.\nThe park recorded a nearly 40% growth in visitor flow and 40% increase in overall income during a five-day holiday beginning May 1 in mainland China, said Pong, who hopes the growth momentum will continue through summer, Halloween and Christmas seasons.\nPandas are considered China’s unofficial national mascot. The country’s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing’s soft-power diplomacy."

Condo owners are collectively seeking more than $165 million in damages, according to the complaint.\nCompleted in 2015, the slender 1,396-foot-tall skyscraper has a 15:1 height-to-width ratio, putting it among the so-called “pencil towers” now dotting midtown Manhattan’s skyline. To protect against high winds, the building was designed with unoccupied floors that encourage airflow, anchors drilled deep into the bedrock and “tuned mass dampers” that act like pendulums to counteract swaying.\nProperty developer Harry Macklowe — whose firm McGraw Hudson Construction Corp is also named in the suit — compared the tower to the Empire State Building, tellingthe New York Timesin 2013 that it was “the building of the 21st century.” Pop starJennifer Lopezand Chinese businessmanYe Jianmingare among those reported to have purchased units there for eight-figure sums.\nBut owners and residents have since complained of numerous construction issues, including more than 20 water leaks since 2017, according to the complaint. In 2021, the condo board filed a lawsuit alleging a range of defects, from malfunctioning elevators and poor energy efficiency to a trash chute that sounds “like a bomb” when used.\nThe new lawsuit meanwhile claims that the tower’s facade is “plagued with thousands of severe cracks, spalling, and other forms of deterioration,” including a 10-inch-deep crack in the building’s core. As well as causing flooding, the damage has corroded some of the steel in the tower’s reinforced concrete columns, the complaint alleges.\nWhile the 2021 complaint also detailed “substantial cracking,” the condo board said it filed its most recent action after claiming it uncovered evidence that defendants had “conspired” to conceal the extent and seriousness of the defects.\nIn statements provided to CNN, both CIM Group and SLCE Architects, the project’s architect of record, said they “vehemently” deny the claims and are moving to have the complaint dismissed. Engineering firm WSP declined to comment.  McGraw Hudson Construction Corp did not respond to CNN’s inquiries.\nRelated articleConstruction of world’s tallest abandoned skyscraper to resume after a decade\nThe lawsuit attributes cracking to the building’s “experimental” facade, which is made from white concrete. The material is, it says, “typically used for aesthetic purposes” and had to be strengthened to withstand the supertall building’s structural load — especially during high winds.\nAmong the suit’s allegations are claims that CIM Group ignored concerns raised by various concrete consultants, as well as the project’s late architectRafael Viñolyabout the strength of the concrete mix. The condo board claims that mockup tests showed the material’s use would result in cracking. But CIM Group and its contractors “bulled forward” with “complete disregard for… the inevitable problems it would cause for the building and its future residents,” the suit adds.\nThe condo board alleges that, despite having knowledge of the facade’s defects, SLCE Architects deceived condo owners by making “materially false” claims in its offering plan, a document disclosing important information to potential buyers. (The lawsuit cites an alleged change in the document’s wording, which went from claiming the concrete “will” prevent water penetration to saying that it was only “designed to” do so.)\nAdditionally, the lawsuit alleges that McGraw Hudson and WSP misled New York City Department of Buildings in a letter that “misrepresented the nature, extent, and type of cracking.” It claims the letter failed to disclose the full findings of a survey that had discovered 1,893 defects.\nThe complaint claims that developers then “repeatedly rejected” recommendations on how to address issues that arose. A suggestion that an opaque elastomeric covering could be applied to the facade to prevent air and water infiltration, for instance, was ignored because it would “significantly alter” the building’s appearance and make it less appealing to “the world’s billionaires,” the lawsuit alleges."

    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/style/queen-elizabeth-ii-memorial-london-shortlist",
    "content": "A pair of gently curved bridges, a bronze oak tree and a lily pad-inspired walkway are among the standout features of five shortlisted designs forQueen Elizabeth II’sofficial memorial site in central London.\nThe national memorial will be built in St. James’s Park, near Buckingham Palace in the heart of the British capital.\nThe finalists, unveiled Wednesday, include some of the UK’s most prominent architecture firms, including Foster + Partners, which designed London’s City Hall and 30 St. Mary Axe (known as The Gherkin), and Heatherwick Studios, the firm behindNew York City’s Vessel structure.\nA panel from The Queen Elizabeth Memorial Committee, which was jointly established by the British government and Royal Household, will announce a winning proposal this summer, according to a press release. The memorial is expected to be unveiled in 2026, marking what would have been the late Queen’s centenary.\nThe design brief asked for “an emotionally powerful place” that celebrates Elizabeth II’s “extraordinary life of service,” while providing the public with a space for reflection.\n“She was part of our national identity and helped to define our values, she gave us a sense of continuity through times of great change, she was integral to recognizing achievement and she exemplified service and duty, strengthened by faith and leavened by pragmatism, optimism and humor,” said committee chair Lord Janvrin, the late Queen’s former private secretary, in the press release.\nRelated articleCoronation portrait of UK’s King Charles unveiled\n“The masterplan design needs to seek inspiration from all this,” he added. “The memorial must be — simply — a beautiful place, a place to visit with friends, a place to gather, to enjoy, and to reflect on an extraordinary life.”\nThe public can view the finalists’ designs as part of an online exhibition and can provide feedback until May 19.\nBridging together\nTo honor Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, Heatherwick Studio proposed an entry with a lily-themed bridge at its heart (pictured top). In a video introducing the design, the firm’s founderThomas Heatherwicksaid Elizabeth II’s values of “togetherness and unity” led his team to conceptualize a “Bridge of Togetherness” that would serve as a gathering place in the park.\nThe design features a sculpture of the late monarch protected by a canopy of “sculptural lilies” at the center of a limestone bridge. The proposal also includes a pathway of 70 limestone “lily pads” signifying the Queen’s 70-year reign, as well as plants that held significance for her.\n“Like her legacy, it is quietly monumental,” reads the firm’s entry. “A memorial grown from the landscape, open to people throughout the world from every walk of life.”\nAnother design looking to themes of harmony was proposed by Foster + Partners, which was inspired by British architect John Nash’s 1820s remodeling of St. James’s Park.\nThe design consists of gardens connected by a network of meandering paths and linked by a “Unity Bridge” symbolizing the Queen as “a powerful force for bringing together people, nations, charities, the Commonwealth, and the Armed Forces,” the firm’s founder, architectNorman Foster, said in a video entry. The pathways will feature Elizabeth II’s words, both as audio installations and inscriptions on the path, including a quote from her 1953 coronation speech: “Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.”\nProposed sculptures include new figurative statues of the Queen and Prince Philip, as well as a “Wind Sculpture” designed by the British artist Yinka Shonibare, intended to serve as a place of “reflection and shared experience.”\nRelated articleIs this the only known portrait of England’s doomed ‘Nine Days Queen’?\n‘The nation’s bedrock’\nThe proposal from landscape architecture studio J&L Gibbons centers on a vision of the late Queen as “the nation’s bedrock” by incorporating a bridge made of literal bedrock. Its layout also “invites forest bathing” in a series of glades surrounded by trees. In its proposal video, the firm said its design represents a quote from the Queen’s1966 Christmas broadcast,in which she spoke to breathing “gentleness and care into the harsh progress of mankind.”\nAlso borrowing from nature is landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith, whose proposal incorporates a replica of a centuries-old oak tree from Windsor Great Park, once the private hunting grounds of the late Queen’s former residence, Windsor Castle.\nStuart-Smith’s team would digitally scan the tree before casting it as a full-size bronze sculpture. Called “The Queen’s Oak” and situated beside a gently curved bridge, the sculpture would be the centerpiece of the site, its lacquered leaves appearing like a “golden mirage reflected in the lake” at night, according to the firm’s entry.\nOther features include bronze casts of flowers from various Commonwealth countries, as well as a “sonic soundscape” playing recorded memories from people whose lives were impacted by Elizabeth II.\nTo create a contemplative experience, architecture firm WilkinsonEyre, which recently restored London’s Battersea Power Station, proposed pathways with “threads” symbolizing the Queen’s life. Visitors can follow each of the threads, which are built around seven themes, including family, nature and the Commonwealth, representing her seven decades of service.\nA pair of bridges, set on two different levels, would give visitors views of the park, royal palaces and the London skyline."

    "title": "Why the Chrysler Building is an Art Deco icon",
    "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/28/style/chrysler-building-art-deco-centennial",
    "content": "Though it only had the distinction of being the world’s tallest building for 11 months, the Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan has remained one of the most recognizable skyscrapers in the world — and a glimmering architectural icon of the Art Deco period, which celebrates its centennial on April 28.\nThe 1920s and 1930s gave rise to buildings such as Chicago’s Tribune Tower and New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel that mixed materials and colors through the use of steel, glass, terracotta, stone and marble. This new modern style prized vertical designs that drew the eye upwards, decorative glass and metalwork with geometric and floral motifs, high-shine lacquered surfaces, and unique sculptural adornments — overall, a movement toward originality instead of references to the past.\n“Until the 1920s, American architects tended to design their buildings with one eye looking over their left shoulder of Europe,” said Anthony W. Robins, a founding member and former vice president of The Art Deco Society of New York, in a phone call. Architectural styles in the US often followed revivals popular across the West, he noted, such as the Greek, Romanesque and Italian Renaissance revivals that fell in and out of favor.\nBut Art Deco didn’t have a name for decades; in 1966, during renewed interest in the era, a group of curators named the style after the “Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes,” which took place on April 28, 1925 in Paris and drew some 16 million visitors over seven months, forging a new period of architecture, design and decorative arts that influenced many parts of the world.\nThe 1,046-foot-tall Chrysler Building, completed in May of 1930, was the pinnacle of both the then-unnamed Art Deco period and the skyscraper boom that rapidly transformed New York City’s skyline. It dethroned the Eiffel Tower as the world’s tallest structure, and was only eclipsed by the Empire State Building before such lofty projects came to a halt as the global economy cratered during the Great Depression, Robins noted.\n“(The Chrysler Building) and the Empire State Building were the culmination of this huge skyscraper race,” he said. “They weren’t the last to open up before the Depression put an end to it, but they were … the two that took the title of the ‘world’s tallest building.’”\nHigher and higher\nDesigned by the architect William van Alen for the automotive magnate Walter P. Chrysler, who took over the project from the developer and politician William H. Reynolds, the tower features a steel frame and white and gray bricks that ascend skyward with three vertical columns of windows on each side, flanked by horizontal rows that appear like notches at each level. Climaxing with a cascade of curvilinear sunbursts at its peak, it tapers off to a gleaming 185-foot-tall spire — one that had to be secretly assembled and erected from the inside to deliver on its promise to become the world’s new tallest building.\nDuring construction, the Chrysler’s superlative was at risk by a structure rising in tandem at 40 Wall Street. Though the New York Timesreportedin October 1929 that Paul Starrett, the downtown building’s developer, denied competing for “height supremacy,” the building plans had changed to accommodate additional floors. The press played up the rivalry over the course of a year, Robins noted, until Van Alen resolved it by having the spire covertly assembled from five parts on the 65th floor and quickly hoisted up in 90 minutes so that competitors would not know its final height until it was completed.\nRelated articleVatican puts Sagrada Família architect on the path to sainthood\nWith the Empire State Building on the horizon, as well as plans for other supertalls that were never built — including the Noyes Building, a monumental, four-block wide, 1,600-foot-tall terracotta tower that, in New York’s skyline, would have only fallen short of One World Trade Center today — the Chrysler Building was the symbol of a rapidly changing skyline.\n“What next February’s skyline will be like it would take a rash guesser to say,” the New York Times journalist H.I. Brock wrote in 1930 of the year ahead. “But it will be different. July’s skyline will be a new skyline, for that matter.”\nStriking details\nWhat makes the Chrysler Building so striking can be attributed, in part, to the experimentation of the Art Deco period, with its variety of textures, colors and materials, including its use of Nirosta steel: a new type of rustproof stainless steel from Germany.\n“The color in the metal — that extraordinary silvery glow of the Nirosta at the top — it just stands out. You get there when the sun hits it on a good day, and it knocks your socks off,” Robins said.\nBut one landmark piece of legislation also contributed to its visual appeal, Robin said. New York City’s 1916 Zoning Resolution — the first citywide zoning code in the US to be established — included a requirement that large buildings taper off as they rise  so as not to block the sun. Van Alen used the Chrysler Building’s five step-like setbacks to vary the design at each level, including ornaments on each ledge. Steel eagle heads and sculptural pineapples can be spotted on different levels, as well as replicas of Chrysler’s 1929 radiator hub caps — a tribute to innovation as well as a direct reference to the building’s original owner.\n“It’s very common among Art Deco skyscrapers that the ornaments, aside from being ornamental, will… tell us who the building was built for and include the building itself in the ornament somewhere,” Robins said.\nThose motifs continue inside, where the skyscraper’s dramatic vertical entrances of polished black granite and recessed glass panels lead visitors into the red marble and yellow travertine lobby. On the ceiling, Edward Trumbull’s monumental mural, “Transport and Human Endeavor,” is dedicated to the human ingenuity and technology that created the building, with a depiction of the skyscraper itself included.\nShifting attitudes\nFor all its favorable attention today, the Chrysler Building was completed to mixed reviews. Architecture critics considered the last-minute spire to be a stunt,accordingto the New York Times. In 1931, the acclaimed critic Lewis Mumfordwrote: “Heaven help the person who critically looks at this building without the help of distance and heavy mists. The ornamental treatment of the facade is a series of restless mistakes.”\nRelated articleThe world’s largest architectural model captures New York City in the ’90s\nThe architectural tides also shifted drastically as the International Style architectural movement swiftly rose to prominence in the 1930s, prizing functionality in its blocky concrete forms with no decor — the antithesis of its predecessors. But with Art Deco’s revival in the 1960s — along with its official name — as well as the skyscraper’s designation as a federal and city landmark in 1976 and 1978, respectively, the Chrysler Building’s renown grew with time.\nThat wasn’t the case for its architect, however, as Van Alen’s promising career dwindled, and he became mired in litigation with his client, Chrysler, over payment for the project. (The courts ultimately ruled in Val Alen’s favor and he received his fee.)\n“The Chrysler isthebuilding in his life, and it was the last major building in his life,” Robins said.\nThough the building was completed in 1930, it took until 1981 for Van Alen’s full vision to be realized, when lighting technicians illuminated the skyscraper’s crown for the first time according to the architect’s original designs.\n“There’s no spire that looks anything like that,” Robins said. “You’re flying over Manhattan — that’s the one that just catches your eye.”"

    "content": "Construction of theworld’s tallestunoccupied skyscraper may resume as early as next week, almost 10 years after work ground to a halt, according to Chinese state media.\nThe 597-meter-tall (1,959-foot) Goldin Finance 117, which topped out in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin but has stood unfinished since 2015 amid major financial difficulties, is now expected to complete in 2027.\nAt 117 stories high, the tower was set to be China’s tallest skyscraper when it broke ground in 2008. The soaring structure was built using “mega columns” to protect against strong winds and earthquakes, while its “walking stick” design was topped by a diamond-shaped atrium containing a swimming pool and observation deck. It was set to contain offices and a five-star hotel on the upper floors, according toarchitects P&T Group.\nBut the project came to a standstill following the 2015Chinese stock market crashthat plunged the future of Hong Kong-based Goldin Properties Holdings into doubt. The real estate developer, whose founder Pan Sutong was once among Hong Kong’s richest businessmen, has since gone into liquidation.\nA new construction permit — which reportedly lists a contract value of almost 569 million yuan ($78 million) — suggests the defunct developer’s title may have been dropped from the building’s name, according to state media. It is unclear whether plans for the “supertall” skyscraper’s use remain unchanged. Neither P&T Group nor BGI Engineering Consultants, the state-owned company named on the permit, responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\nOver the last decade, the abandoned skyscrapers littering China’s skylines have become emblematic of the country’s real estate woes. In 2020, its housing ministry and National Development and Reform Commissionissued guidelinesbanning new towers over 500 meters (1,640 feet) in height — a move seemingly aimed, in part, at reining in the speculative financing often underpinning skyscraper projects.\nRelated articleNo taller than 500M, no plagiarism: China signals ‘new era’ for architecture\nOn Monday, China’s Greenland Group announced that work is also resuming on the previously stalled Chengdu Greenland Tower in the southwestern city of Chengdu, local state-owned media reported. Construction of the 468-meter-tall (1,535-foot) skyscraper has been on hold since 2023, after the state-owned developer encountered financial difficulties,according to Reuters.\nThe fact that two high-profile projects are resuming at the same time is unlikely to be a coincidence, said Qiao Shitong, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and the author of two books on Chinese real estate.\n“The national government has made it clear it wants to stabilize the real estate market,” said Qiao over a video call, adding that it has been encouraging local governments to help “revive” the struggling sector. “It is signaling to the market — (it’s) not only about the skyscrapers themselves.”\nAlthough the Tianjin tower’s new financing is yet to be disclosed, Qiao believes the state has offered investment and debt restructuring to help kickstart the project.\n“(Supertall skyscrapers) are not necessarily the most efficient projects and they are not necessarily making profits, but they are indicators,” he said. “By having this project revived and completed, the government at least hopes it can increase people’s confidence.”\nFor local officials, completing abandoned skyscrapers is also about “the image of the city,” said Fei Chen, a reader in architecture and urban design at the UK’s University of Liverpool. “They don’t want a project to be unfinished and to stay like that, which is an eyesore for everyone.”\nChen stressed, however, that the resumption of projects in Tianjin and Chengdu is unlikely to herald a return to the “vanity projects” of recent years.\n“The government is conscious that although these (skyscraper) projects have some positive effects on the area, they require too much investment and are not financially or environmentally sustainable… I think the general urban development trend is not changed by the fact that some projects are being resumed. I think it’s more about local government efforts to make their city better.”\nDespite economic concerns and tightening regulations, China continues to dominate global skyscraper construction. Of the 133 skyscrapers measuring 200 meters or above completed around the world last year, 91 were in China, according todatafrom the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\nChen said that skyscrapers, although expensive to build, are often used by developers as “magnets” for investment in the surrounding area. Goldin Finance 117, for instance, was part of a wider development containing villas, commercial buildings and offices, as well as a convention center, entertainment center and polo club. The fate of these projects is not explicitly outlined in the new construction permit, though it reportedly describes the development of several “commercial corridors.”\nRelated articleThe skyscrapers where nobody lives\nBut with sluggish property sales and struggling office occupancy rates across China, the project’s economic viability remains in question, said Qiao. “It’s a huge investment,” he added “And I seriously don’t know who is going to buy or rent this commercial space.”\nDuring the decade-long hiatus, Tianjin welcomed another supertall skyscraper — the Tianjin CTF Finance Centre, which at 530 meters (1,739 feet) is currently the world’s eighth tallest completed building. Goldin Finance 117 has meanwhile been surpassed in height by both the twisting Shanghai Tower and the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, meaning it would now only become the country’s third tallest (and the world’s sixth tallest) skyscraper upon completion.\nIt will fall to eighth globally if Saudi Arabia’s kilometer-high Jeddah Tower — on which construction alsorecently resumed,following a years-long hiatus — and Dubai’sBurj Aziziare both completed later this decade.\nCNN’s Fred He and Hassan Tayir contributed to this report."

    "content": "Antoni Gaudí, the celebrated Catalan long nicknamed “God’s architect” for designingBarcelona’sSagrada Família, has been put on the path to sainthood by the Vatican.\nIn a statement released on Monday, the Vatican saidPope Francisrecognized Gaudí’s “heroic virtues,” which is a step on the path to sainthood.\nBecoming a saint is a complex process that can take hundreds of years, however, since a candidate normally needs two miracles to be attributed to their intercession.\nFinding those miracles will be the next step if Gaudí is to beatified and then canonized. Commissions of doctors and theologians then examine the miracles before the pope makes the ultimate decision to canonize someone.\nGaudí is a rare case. Few artists become saints and no architect, in the modern understanding of the profession, has ever been canonized.\nGaudí’s legacy is intrinsically linked with Catholicism as he dedicated much of his career to the Sagrada Família – a church of such awesome splendor that it remains unfinished more than 140 years after construction began.\nHe envisioned the church to be “a Bible in stone” and designed a monumental structure with 18 huge, spindle-shaped towers, each symbolizing a different biblical figure – the 12 apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus.\nWhen it is finally completed in 2026, the tower of Jesus Christ will stand at 172.5 meters (566 feet) tall and will be finished with a 17-meter-tall (56-foot) four-armed cross, making it the world’s tallest church.\nInside, the nave is bathed in multicolored light that streams in from every direction through ornately decorated stained-glass windows.\nGaudí never saw the church anywhere near completion. He died in 1926, when only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall.\nAlthough Gaudí dedicated the remaining few years of his life and career exclusively to the Sagrada Família, other buildings bearing his distinctive style are dotted all over Barcelona, lending the city much of its character.\nFor decades, there has been a movement calling for Gaudí’s beatification, known as the Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí. The Archbishop of Barcelona took up that cause in 2023 and submitted thepositio,or key argument, for Gaudí’s beatification to the Vatican.\nCNN’s Jack Guy and Amarachi Orie contributed reporting."

But if you were in the bedroom where they shoot their material, likeArsenal’s Champions League win at Real Madrid, you’d hardly hear a thing.\n“I feel like it’s a whisper,” said Archie in an interview withCNN Sports, noting that the lip synching of the original commentary only requires them to mime the words. “It’s a soft yell, if I was yelling then I’d have no voice!”\nShepmates, as the duo is known, began almost by accident. The 23-year-old identical twins were working together as salesmen at a timber yard in 2021 and Miles was listening to the Ashescricketon the radio. When the Australian bowler Mitchell Starc claimed an English wicket with the very first ball of the match, the commentator’s contagious enthusiasm inspired him to film his own reenactment of the call.\n“It was Covid, so I was bored,” he recalled, “and I just filmed this video and the next morning it blew up and people were asking for more.

No sport is off the table – Shepmates say that sperm racing could even be in the pipeline soon.\nA post shared by shepmates (@shepmates)\nSitting side by side and wearing broadcast headsets, they dress according to the sport they are covering and exchange either smug, knowing glances or accusatory and puzzled looks. At the crescendo of each play that they feature, the scene often descends into chaos; when filmingHarry Maguire’s dramatic late winner for Manchester United in the Europa League, Archie rocked the camera for dramatic effect as Miles threw a chair across the room, damaging the wall: “The landlord wasn’t happy.”\nWhen the darts commentator Wayne Mardle gasped, “I can’t speak, I can’t speak,” the Shepmates’ interpretation of the moment spoofed a commentator falling backwards in a state of medical distress.\nThe brothers often switch positions in their pretend commentary box, making it impossible to tell which one is which, and sometimes they’re even able to quickly duck out of shot, change their appearance and re-appear as a third character just seconds later. They’ve become skilled at repackaging the energy and joy of sport with a humorous twist, their repertoire has found a global audience and they’ve been able to quit the lumber yard and focus full-time on the Shepmates media brand.\nInitially, each shoot was labor intensive. Miles said that he used to spend hours trying to memorize every line – “a nightmare.” Now, they write the lines out on a screen, using a series of commas and dots to time their delivery.\n“It doesn’t matter how good our facial expressions or the comedy,” Miles explained, “if the lip-sync’s not good then people aren’t going to watch it.”\nHe’s become an expert in mimicking Spanish and Arabic commentary, but admits he has no idea what they’re saying.\n“Most of the clips we can nail in four or five shots, we have a ball,” said Archie, “But you start screwing up, then it starts to wear a bit towards the end, like you’ve heard this commentary close to 40 times and by the time you put it out, you’re like, ‘I don’t even know if this is funny.’”\nTheir fans would argue that the labor of love is well worth it, and so far, they say that the commentators they’ve covered approve of their work, but in 2024 they were accused of a gross invasion of privacy when they filmedMercedes F1 driver George Russellin the urinal.\n“That was a big moment for us,” Miles explained, “It felt like we were on top of the world, and I think we probably just got a bit ahead of ourselves and we made a mistake. We were like, ‘Jeez, are we bad humans for doing this?’ We apologized to George. I wouldn’t change it, I’m glad it happened. It made us realize we’re not invincible, I think it’s made us better.”\nArchie and Miles have grown up together, they still live together and now they’re embarking on a dream career together that they could never have imagined when they were making videos together as kids. Miles acknowledges that they have suffered from an imposter syndrome.\n“Do we deserve all this?” he asked. “A lot of the time we’re worried it’s going to get taken away from us.”\n“We tried to become professional athletes and failed at that,” Archie added, “So I think the stars aligned with sports and content.”\nIn a manner that they never could have imagined, they have found their calling."

    "content": "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has added an advanced driver-assistance system for most of its models at no additional cost, catapulting its shares to a record high.\nChinese customers can now experience the carmaker’s proprietary “God’s Eye” driver-assistance system in models that cost as little as 69,800 yuan ($9,555).\nAnalysts said the move could further fuel a brutal, ongoing price war in the world’s biggest car market.\nShares of BYD surged more than 4% to a record high, according to Refinitiv data, when trading in Hong Kong began on Tuesday. Its shares were last trading at 330 Hong Kong dollars ($42).\n“2025 will be the first year of intelligent driving for all,” BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu said inan eventfrom its headquarters in Shenzhen on Monday.\nWang predicted that high-level intelligent driving will become an essential feature in automobiles, much like seat belts and airbags, within the next three years.\nPreviously, the “God’s Eye” feature, introduced in 2023 to assist car navigation, was only offered in BYD models costing more than $30,000.\nBYD ranked sixth in global car sales, with China’s Geely Auto following in tenth, Wang said onstage, citing research from Cailianshe, a state-linked media firm. It also dominated the Chinese market, accounting for over 32% of total new energy vehicle sales in 2024, according toChina Passenger Car Association.\nTu Le, founder and managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said BYD’s move “puts their competitors on their heels” because of the affordable pricing.\nTesla, BYD’s main rival, has released similar Full Self-Driving features in the US for a subscription fee of $99 a month or a one time payment of $8,000. It awaits regulatory approval to launch trials in the Chinese market.\nTesla may need to rethink its subscription-based strategy when entering China, Le added.\nBesides Tesla, BYD’s announcement is expected to put pressure other Chinese competitors like Xpeng and Geely Auto, whose shares dropped on Tuesday.\nAt Monday’s event, the company also announced its plan to integrate DeepSeek, the AI model from a Chinese startup that made global headlines last month with a high-performing chatbot that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT, into BYD cars.\nBYD is known for its aggressive pricing strategy. The price war, sparked by Tesla two years ago, has become so intense that BYDasked its supplierslate last year to deliver hefty price reductions of 10% for the coming year."

    "content": "As we all live more of our lives online, it’s important to understand who might have access to our conversations and internet searches – and to understand how to maintain privacy in an increasingly connected world.\nIn the days since billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency associates haveblazed through various government agencies, journalists have encouraged federal government workers to contact them through end-to-end encrypted platforms, like the messaging app Signal.\nSignal is one of a number of relativelysimple toolsthat can be used not only to help keep secure conversations with reporters, but also for communicating with colleagues when not discussing work projects, researching legal resources or even chatting with friends.\nUse personal devices and networks\nIt’s safe to assume that anything you do on a work computer or phone could be visible to  your employer, because they have the right to monitor usage of devices they own.\n“You want to think about who has access to the communications that you’re making if you’re worried that someone might try to retaliate you for having these discussions,” said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist for the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.\nWith that in mind, it’s a good idea to use a personal device for personal conversations and Google searches.\nThe same goes for using an employer’s Wi-Fi network, on which they may be able to connect the dots between employee communications. Save any griping about work for your home network or your personal phone plan.\nOn work Wi-Fi, “they won’t necessarily see what tea you’re spilling, but they will see who you’re spilling it to,” Gillmor said.\nSignal\nThere are a number of tech platforms that advertise encryption services for privacy — including iMessage and WhatsApp — but data security experts largely agree thatSignalis the gold standard.\nSignal looks like a regular messaging app for texting and making phone calls. But it’s owned by a non-profit, not a private company, and the app is end-to-end encrypted by default. That means that the content of a conversation is scrambled when it’s traveling between the sender and receiver, so no one except the parties to the conversation can see it.\nRelated articleThey lived through Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover. Now, they have advice for federal government employees\n“If you show up with a warrant or a subpoena (to Signal), they have almost nothing about you that they can hand over,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. On non-encrypted messaging apps, an employer or law enforcement could potentially force a platform to hand over a user’s conversations via subpoena.\nEnd-to-end encryption itself isn’t unique among messaging apps, but certain apps that offer encryption, like WhatsApp, may still have access to non-encrypted contacts and other accounts you’ve messaged, whereas Signal’s builders can’t see that information, according to Gillmor.\nAnd whether you use Signal or WhatsApp, experts advise turning on the “disappearing messages” feature that allows users to auto-delete conversations after a set period of time — hours, or days, depending on what a user selects — so that the conversations might not be accessible even if someone else got their hands on a user’s phone.\nTor browser\nMany people are familiar with VPNs, or virtual private networks, which act kind of like a tunnel between your device and the internet that can mask where your internet traffic is coming from.\nVPNs can be a more private way of accessing the internet, but nevertheless, the VPN company could, in theory, be forced to hand over the information it has about your internet traffic.\n“When you use a VPN, the VPN company can see all your traffic, they see where you’re coming from and where you’re going. So, if somebody on the other end of the transaction sees an IP address that belongs to a VPN company, they can submit a subpoena to the VPN company,” Galperin said.\nThe most secure option, security experts say, is to use Tor browser. It’s a browser that users can download just like Firefox or Safari, but that distributes internet traffic across a global network of different “nodes,” or computers, so that any one user’s traffic could not be accessed from a single access point. With Tor, the websites a user visits are also blocked from viewing that user’s IP address, which could allow them to be identified.\nIf you’ve used Tor and “someone later sends a warrant to Google asking for all the searches that have been made from your home computer or your logged-in Google browser, they won’t see searches for ‘good journalist to leak to,’” Galperin said.\nMany news organizations also haveSecureDropfolders, allowing users to share encrypted documents and communications anonymously when using Tor.\nOther best practices\nSome companies have taken aggressive measures to identify employees who leak information, such as watermarking or tweaking emails so that different employees receive slightly different versions of the same message.\nFor that reason, security experts encourage people to be cautious about sending exact copies or photos of emails or documents. And any documents printed out could include “printer dots,” invisible tracking codes that can indicate the time, date and location where something was printed.\nAnd keep in mind that violating a non-disclosure agreement or sharing confidential information could expose you to legal risk if you are identified.\nStill, Gillmor said it can be a good idea to identify private channels of communication with colleagues or friends.\n“Protecting our rights is a team sport,” Gillmor said. “Taking the time to figure out how to do some of these things and helping your friends figure out how to do these things, even if you never end up using them in more drastic ways … is still a positive thing.”"

    "content": "DeepSeek’s advances have roiled global stock markets and AI players. Now, its influence is spreading quickly at home, with some of China’s biggest tech companies, many of which had been developing their own chatbots, racing to incorporate the open-source model into their own services.\nIn early February telecoms giant Huawei said it would run DeepSeek on its own computing hardware composed of its Ascend computer processors, which are domestically produced.\nSome AI watchers have hailed this as a turning point, as it demonstrates that a high-performing model like DeepSeek no longer requires Nvidia’s most powerful chips to operate.\n“This partnership defies US sanctions by proving China can deliver globally competitive AI performance using domestically developed AI hardware and software stack, replacing Nvidia chips with Ascend chips,” analysts at Bernstein, an investment and research firm, wrote in a research note earlier this month.\nStartingin late 2022, the Biden Administration imposed several rounds of export controls on China in an effort to deprive the country of technology that Washington fears Beijing could use to make the next generation of weapons and AI systems.\nBut the success of DeepSeek’s latest R1 AI model, which is said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of established players like ChatGPT, challenged the assumption that cutting off access to advanced chips could successfully stymie China’s progress.\nSuch is DeepSeek’s fame that leading Chinese AI chipmakers — including Moore Threads, Tencent-backed Enflame, Baidu’s Kunlunxin and Hygon Information Technology — have also announced support for the firm, running the AI model on their own computing chips.\nBeyond chips\nBeyond chipmakers, the cloud arms of major Chinese technology companies have also rushed to incorporate DeepSeek’s technology into their offerings.\nRelated articleChina celebrates DeepSeek’s breakout AI success as tech race heats up\nAlibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and TikTok parentBytedance announced they had made Deepseek’s service available through their cloud platforms. The country’s three major telecom operators, along with electronics maker Lenovo and auto brand Geely, have also adopted DeepSeek into their cloud platforms and products.\n“It serves as recognition for open-source large-model companies. If your model is good enough, AI giants will integrate it into their platforms,” said Lian Jye Su, chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research firm.\nThese major Chinese tech firms, which have dominated the country’s internet scene for more than a decade, began rolling out their own large language models over the past two years since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.\nDespite having competing products they have welcomed DeepSeek. Su said the primary reason for their adoption is to attract more people and businesses to use their platforms.\n“In reality, making money directly from large models is difficult for AI giants — unless there are mature consumer and enterprise applications to support them,” he said.\nTheir moves reflect a wider trend. American Big Tech — including Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon — have similarly embraced DeepSeek.\nTopping the charts\nDeepseek, the Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, sentshock wavesaround the world last month when it launched its newest AI model.\nIts AI Assistant app quickly topped global download charts, surpassing ChatGPT in late January. Within 20 days of launch, its daily active users have exceeded 22 million, according tostate media.\nIts success has catapulted its founder, Liang Wenfeng, into the ranks of national heroes. Despite the optimism, analysts caution that bottlenecks in China’s AI chip development remain due to US export restrictions.\n“Porting DeepSeek models to different chip architectures is a lot of low-level software work, and the fact they could do so quickly is amazing, but it doesn’t solve the chip shortage problem,” said Linghao Bao, senior analyst at Trivium China, a research and advisory firm.\nThe ramp-up of advanced chip production continues to be hampered by the absence of advanced chipmaking equipment, which the US has banned from being exported to China, he said.\nAnd outside China, DeepSeek’s rapid rise has drawn scrutiny from various governments. Last week, Taiwan andAustraliabanned their government officials from using the Chinese AI service over data security risks.\nSome South Korean ministries and government departments have also issued bans. Last month, Italy imposed a blanket block on DeepSeek’s app after the company failed to address privacy concerns raised by the authorities. More countries have since raised concerns over the firm’s data practices."
